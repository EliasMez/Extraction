%7Etimpaek;1;Varun MaudgalyaTim is one of the most charismatic and truly visionary leaders that I've had the opportunity to work with during my time at Apple. As a machine learning engineer working in Tim's org over several years, I've had firsthand experience of how Tim navigates pursuing innovative projects which push the limits of what's technologically possible at a large company. He has a seemingly uncanny ability to repeatedly select home-run research projects which not only played to the team's strengths and delighted our users, but also gave the company a competitive advantage. One such initiative which I led under Tim's guidance was Back Tap, a project which we successfully designed, prototyped, and shipped to production. I'm particularly grateful for Tim's mentorship over the years, which significantly contributed to my personal growth both as a leader and as an engineer.

I feel confident to say that he can be a great asset to any organization and help to make things better and efficient.
aashitkamath;2;"Lewis LimI had the pleasure of having Aashit as a student in my Accountable Marketing Decisions class in The Nanyang MBA program in November/December 2014. Aashit was the leader of the team that topped the Markstrat Simulation competition that was the central activity of the class. In Markstrat, students assume the roles of marketing managers for a hypothetical firm and make a series of decisions including brand portfolio management, research & development for new brands, price-setting, and advertising and channel strategies over multiple periods to grow the firm's market and financial performance. Students have to make decisions under uncertainty responding to evolving market situations and facing constant competitive pressure. Aashit's team did extremely well in the Markstrat challenge; they grew their business by following disciplined approach to balancing investments risks and returns while expanding their product line in response to changing market needs. Aashit's leadership of the team was very visible and his contributions to the team's performance was well reflected in the peer evaluations submitted to me at the end of the course. In class, Aashit was also an active participant, often contributing valuable perspectives and constructive comments during discussions. He was well respected for his maturity of thought and confidence, and well liked for his pleasant personality and helpfulness. I greatly enjoyed interacting with him and believe he has the traits of business leader. I wish him well in his endeavors."

%F0%9F%94%B9-alessia-tan-%F0%9F%94%B9-236a18106;1;Richard Low ( Coach Trainee )Performance review for Alessia Tan:\nPeople tend to listen and follow her example and guidance. Alessia is chosen as leader without making an issue of leadership. Physically fit, very rarely sick, and able to meet the demands of a physically demanding job. Alessia enjoys public speaking, and is very well received by audiences. Eloquent, clear, persuasive, interesting, always captures the interest and fires the imagination of listeners. Comfortable in any situation, even when speaking. \n\nAlways eager to take on a new task, whether hard or simple, and tackles it diligently, without question or complaint. This positive attitude inspires others too. When ideas are challenged by others, Alessia listens to their view politely, but is able to maintain a position firmly and persuasively without aggression. When dressed for the job, personal appearance and dress immediately impress. Distinctive, perhaps distinguished. Always succeeds in explaining ideas clearly. Others find Alessia easy to understand. She also has the ability to listen carefully to what others are saying, to understand and then to respond appropriately. Conversations with Alessia are two-way. \nShe sets very high standards, aware that this will bring attention and promotion.

Cherishes the credit he gets to the fullest.

aaron10leong;1;Jinella ChuaAaron was part of a SMU team of four leaders who planned and executed an overseas project called Zero Limits. The Zero Limits South Africa project was planned in 2013 and took place in 2014. A total of 12 students rode from Durban to Cape Town to deliver Christmas Greetings and presents contributed by Singaporeans to several orphanages along the route.Aaron and team were resourceful and meticulous in sourcing for sponsors (DHL, Nikon, Cannondale, etc.) to help make the trip a possibility. Their careful planning and months of training, as well as a recce trip prior to the actual expedition ensured that not only were hundreds of Christmas wishes fulfilled, the learning journey of the group of 12 stretched beyond the month spent in South Africa and carried them steadily through their daily lives after. Aaron as a leader was instrumental in helping to conceptualize the project and together with his partners and eventually the group as a whole, managed to pull off one of the most meaningful Zero Limits trips that SMU has ever witnessed. I was fortunate enough to have accompanied them on the trip, working with the team first hand on managing day to day circumstances as well as the occasional risk management that arises with being in an unknown place.Aaron has grown and matured as an individual from the time he took up the responsibility to now. I have no doubt the seeds of positive growth were planted in the time leading up to the trip and continue to bear fruit till now.

He always tried to ask me about work environment, 'Is it good for you?' or 'How's your day? ' , even at that time, I was very nervous to answered and more often be quiet because I know that my English is not good enough. Too afraid if there's something that'll be misunderstanding.

abawany;1;Melissa Murray BaileyThere are few people who can inject positive energy into such a large team as I have witnessed Adam do in my organization. When we set off on our journey of inspiring excellence, we defined it in three ways. First, set a high bar and commit to it. Next, rally the troops. And third, make sure this is a journey of continuous improvement. When I think about Adam, he is someone who embodies all three of those things. From Day One, he raised our bar on how we think about building relationships. He generated millions of dollars in pipeline and closed a significant amount of deals personally.What truly sets him apart is his heart is so big! He gives so much of himself as the Social Impact Singapore ERG leader and has changed the course of so many people\u2019s lives through the generous gift of his time and talents to others.

He was the Singapore Social Impact Lead for over a year and under his leadership, brought new and fresh initiatives to get our employees excited over our Social Impact events.

He was able to do all this, while managing a team of 12 committee members whilst smashing his day-job at LinkedIn. Adam's ability to deliver in extremely demanding situations with authenticity and enthusiasm is exceptional. It's rare to come across an incredibly high achiever who leads from the heart and constantly thinks of ways to give back to others - Adam makes this look very easy. It's been an honour to have him lead the Singapore office, and I look forward to working with him again.

abbasi-mirza-3a88099;2;I have known Abbasi for around five years as we both started at GP Global within a few months of each other. \n\nAt this time we shared a reporting channel and it quickly became obvious to me that Abbasi was under utilised by the wider group and that he had a significant capacity to accumulate knowledge and apply it within both rigid and more flexible processes. As a consequence and when seeking to build my own Bunker Credit Management team I was both offered, and readily accepted Abbasi to join on a shared basis alongside his other duties that included but were not limited to internal audit.\n\nInterestingly internal audit and the bunker credit function are good bed-fellows as our MO was to deliver first class advice, recommendations and services by rigidly applying our processes, and who better to be involved than someone with an internal audit and process background.\n\nOver time Abbasi became a trusted, reliable and highly capable member of a growing team and the share of time allocated to functions I needed him for steadily grew and real consideration was given to securing his services fully for my team. However, this period also allowed me to learn more about his experience, qualifications and capabilities. This resulted in me recommending him for advancement on a number of occasions, culminating in his appointment as Head Special Projects and Internal Audit. Despite taking this task on he continued to support where his skill sets were suited, the measure of a true team player professional, and friend.\n\nThrough this new role he was involved in the establishment of our new GSS operations, and instrumental in delivering online and intranet embedded versions of our Credit Model, Exposure Tracking Dashboard for bunker, 3C credit and compliance checking tool, quick deal entry and margin calculator tools.\n\nConsistent and reliable, I cannot recommend Abbasi highly enough, whilst often tough he has the capacity to empathise, and to deliver solutions that meet both user needs whilst delivering underpinning management goals.\n\nI look forward to further opportunities to work alongside Abbasi.

6663548;1;It was incredible working with Ned during the past couple of years. Although the org chart said Ned reported to me, he was truly an equal who I relied on daily to build the Hortonworks business throughout APAC, not just in his home territory.Ned always did the right thing for the customer and for the company regardless of whatever challenges faced him. His combination of customer relationship skills and technical skills are simply deadly. At least one of the challenges he faced daily was being outmanned by larger competitors...but we still won accounts Ned was involved in because of the truth: Ned is the equal of a cadre of his competitors' peers.
6663548;2;Ned was one of the best Presales engineers I have worked with. During his time at EMC, his passion for big data really shone through and he went on a mission to find new opportunities and open doors that we hadn't previously been able to crack. Ned has a passion for continual self-learning, which is one of the key traits we look for at EMC. While he is technically very capable, his ability to drive thought leadership in the market, build relationships and create communities is exceptional.

elizabeth-haq-78740973;1;Liz is a force of nature. Although she was a fellow and not a permanent staffer, you never would have known it, because she brought considerable expertise to the table in the areas of social engagement, content strategy, and measuring audience impact, as well as editing, reporting, and aggregating. Together we operated The Trace's social media channels, where we covered active shootings, eulogized gun violence victims, collaborated on videos for Twitter and Facebook (though she did the vast majority of the work \u2014 and, who are we kidding, all of the editing), and brainstormed special projects (though, again, Liz did most of the heavy lifting). Plus, she's a wordsmith par excellence. I found myself jotting down casual phrases she tossed off because even her offhand comments were gold. \n\nWhat's most admirable about Liz is that she had a lot of experience managing teams and projects before she came to The Trace, so a time-limited fellowship was technically a step down the career ladder for her (not that she would have ever described it that way). But she wanted to learn about America's gun violence crisis, and coming from another, more peaceful country, she was able to bring a fresh perspective to her work at The Trace that was much appreciated. \n\nI just can't say enough about Liz. She's just so lovely to work with, especially when the subject matter can be so grim. She's the person you want to brainstorm with in a foxhole. Any team would be lucky to have her as a leader. I just pray she remembers me when she's a media mogul. 
elizabeth-haq-78740973;2;Liz Haq is passionate, curious and smart -- three natural talents that will help her in journalism and many other fields.\n\nLiz was in my Reporting class at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism, and I was her editor for her Master's Project, a six-month assignment that produces a magazine-length story. Liz wrote a deeply researched, well-written piece about the issues elderly prisoners face after they are released. \n\nWhile many students have trouble finding topics to write about, Liz always had a lot of good ideas. She devotes herself to her assignments and is easy to talk to, which allowed her to get access to people and information that others couldn't. These traits are also proving useful in her book research.\n\nLiz would be an asset in any newsroom. She is talented, versatile and a pleasure to work with.

diana-boyd;1;Consultative and Transparent. Cannot recommend working with Diana highly enough. We are mid cycle on martech evaluation and considering the sales solution for our team. I am extremely picky with tools that go to the Field, Diana (and Tim) have provided extra session, provided knowledge on day in the life with the tool, and have been extremely transparent with potential pitfalls.

mel-trottier-27670546;1;I met Mel when she was a part time sales associate.

Mel owns her responsibilities, knows her stuff, and gets the job done!

rosa-raponi-newton-1607b547;1;In 2003, I became very depressed. It was also the year of the SARS outbreak so there was no room for me to be admitted to hospital. Because I needed care urgently, my doctor assigned Rosa as my occupational therapist to provide me with in-home support. \r\n\r\nMy depression was so debilitating that I was spending my days in bed till late afternoon. When Rosa called to make an appointment to see me, I told her I wasn\u2019t interested. But Rosa kept on persisting until I finally did agree to see her. After our first appointment in my home, Rosa would insist that I meet her at Dundas Square. She\u2019s very wise. She knew I needed to get out of my house and recognize that a whole world existed outside my depressive bubble. I soon looked forward to our appointments.

I\u2019m deeply grateful for her role in my life.

For the team and myself, we were never just at a job. Rafael seemingly effortlessly, developed a team inspired and driven to problem-solve, find new and interesting solutions to daily challenges and to contribute creatively while under a heavy workload with tight deadlines. \r\n\r\nRafael is a man with vision, compassion and drive. I would recommend him as a valuable asset to any team. \r\n\r\nDuncan Creamer
rafaelziah;2;Rafael is the most eternally optimistic person I know. His belief that his excellent ideas for projects will be possible somehow always turns out to be right. Must be his bottomless well of talent and the knowledge sponge he calls a brain. \r\n\r\nRafael, in addition to being a great cinematographer, editor and showrunner, wants to know everything there is to know about making films. If it seems as though he is most of the way there already, it's only because whatever job he is doing (extremely well) on a project, he is also learning everything he possibly can from the other professionals around him. When Rafael works on a project, he'll come away from the job with ten ideas for his next production and 100 new things he wants to try. And his next project is invariably amazing and full of cool techniques and skills you didn't see on his last project.\r\n\r\nRafael's talent and bottomless energy and wealth of ideas for new projects is evident upon meeting him. What you learn as you get to know him is that he always delivers on the promise of that first meeting. You can't do better than putting Rafael on your team. Better yet, join his team and be prepared to be part of something great,unique and successful.
rafaelziah;3;Inspiring doesn't begin to describe the creative process Rafael brings to every project lucky enough to have him involved.\r\n\r\n His focus, energy, positive disposition and incredible talents are difficult to sum up as he seems to know how to do every step of the creative process on his own or with a huge team. He has taught me so much and every project we have collaborated on has been an honor and pleasure for me and my clients.\r\n\r\n I would recommend Rafael with the most enthusiastic endorsement possible and if you have a chance to work with him don't miss it.

jeanne-nethania-taufiq-a886681a0;1;Serving as a SFU SOUL mentor has proven to be a rewarding experience, and being matched with Jeanne was the highlight. As a mentor, I had requested the SOUL team to select a candidate not based on a particular industry that I was in, but to choose someone that had the motivation, dedication, and passion to learn and challenge themselves - and I must say, the team did a great job in choosing the right mentee as a match. My first time meeting Jeanne, she was someone that had a determination for self-growth, someone who is curious, and wasn\u2019t shy to take a step forward to challenge herself. She has the same passion for self-improvement, and carries an open mind with a can-do attitude, even in the mid of uncertainties. Over time with a few challenges tossed her way, I've seen time after time that she's proven herself and overcome personal obstacles to improve and reach her goals. I have enjoyed my interaction with Jeanne and hope to continue to be her resource, and see our mentor-mentee relationship grow as she grows. I look forward to the range of opportunities that she will embark on.
jeanne-nethania-taufiq-a886681a0;2;Jeanne is a hardworking, dedicated, and has such a positive energy.

chris-pughe-amp-she-her-ba6208b;1;When I made the decision to buy my first home I knew little about navigating the mortgage world but had the good fortune of being connected with Chris. From our first call she put me at ease and cut through all the mortgage jargon, sharing her extensive knowledge and clearly laying out my options.

noemie-landry-boisvert;1;My team was fortunate to have Noemie intern with us for the summer this year. I had 2 projects that I was hoping to have our intern look at. The first was a modification to our existing angular based cloud application and the second was a complete rewrite of that same application in ReactJS. I thought it unlikely that the intern would finish the first project, and if so would maybe be able to make a little progress on the second. Noemie blew us all away with her technical skills and agility when learning new things. She finished both projects to completion and was also able to create a nice React based template application for us that we are using in future projects. Amazingly, she did not know much React when she started. He ability to learn, to articulate roadblocks before getting stuck and to communicate her design and implementation details are far above the level of intern and more along the lines of a much more senior level engineer. The amount of work she was able to turn out in her short internship along with her ability to present that work to the rest of the team made her invaluable to our team. I could not recommend anyone higher than I would recommend Noemie for a future position in software development.
noemie-landry-boisvert;2;Noemie is one of the smartest and most productive intern students I have ever worked with in my career. Working in the same scrum team, Noemie collaborated with me on setting up the infrastructure to test and monitor the performance behavior of the micro services our team build. She started from scratch to ramp up the relevant technologies, such as Prometheus Grafana and etc..And what impressed me a lot is the amazing short period of time for her to master them. Right now without any doubts, she is already the go-to person of relevant domains in our team.\r\n\r\nNoemie\u2019s capability quickly convinced the team that she was the right team member to take on more challenging work, so as expected, Noemie was able to change the source in the core of those micro services to improve their efficiency and functionality to support more performance metrics.\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleased experience to work with Noemie in the past few months. She is very easy to communicate and her answers to my questions were always sufficient and even more than I expected -- patience is another precious merit for college students. But I does see this from Noemie. \r\n\r\nI believe Noemie is the asset for any team and she is ready to handle and challenge jobs in the future.

scott-bagnall-7b1a701;1;I have had the honour to work with Scott for three years now and have seen him excel in multiple roles, including enterprise project portfolio management and more recently as the account executive, leading the entire multi-million dollar / year client account which employs in excess of 100 members.\n\nScott is a true leader, empowering those around him to reach their highest potential by supporting and inspiring them. He has a keen sense for business and understands what drives his stakeholders. In turn, he is a great mentor and helps those around him to benefit to the fullest from his insight and analytical skills.\n\nScott is also extremely personable.He is easy to talk to and collaborate with. His friendly demeanor allows not only his team and peers to work comfortably to their fullest potential, but also makes the client feel confident and at ease, knowing that Scott will do the right thing and always have their best interests top of mind.\n\nAny organization would be lucky to have Scott help lead their team.
scott-bagnall-7b1a701;2;In the early days of the rollout of consumer broadband technology Optus led the national telecommunications industry in bringing to market the first ADSL product offering in Australia.\r\nAs the Senior Project Manager for the ADSL project, Scott Bagnall filled the pivotal role of coordinating business and technology stakeholders into a single, focused delivery team, successfully bridging organisational and cultural divisions within Optus, enabling and empowering diverse capabilities across the organisation, from Internet engineering through to sales and marketing, to deliver an outstanding product on time and under budget.\r\nIn my 18 year career testing enterprise scale software implementations I have seldom, if ever, worked alongside a program manager with the vision and determination that Scott displayed in delivering the project.\r\nScott realised at the outset that if Optus was to deliver this groundbreaking product offering to the market ahead of our competitors we were going to need to leverage the latest technologies and project management methods. Scott was the first project manager I had worked with who was willing to look beyond the status quo and embrace innovative testing methodologies and tooling solutions.\r\nWhile remaining entirely outcome focused, Scott was able to envision a development and test model that was on the cutting edge of what was possible at the time and did so with the common sense and pragmatic approach required to bring the other key stakeholders in the programme on this journey into new territory.\r\nRight from the start, Scott appointed and then encouraged, enabled and empowered his team to think outside of the box, all the while providing support and guidance that allowed everyone on the project to achieve results that at the outset we were not aware that we could achieve.\r\nI would recommend Scott Bagnall to any chief information officer or business division manager faced with the challenge of delivering a project of work that requires innovation and courage to deliver.\r\nScott exemplifies the ability to maintain grace under pressure and many times during the course of what was an intense 14 month project it was his calm sense of self-reliance that inspired me and the rest of my team to become a unit that was greater than the sum of our parts and to deliver an outcome that was beyond what we initially thought possible of ourselves.\r\n\r\n

dnslum;1;Having Denise as a director of HR is not just someone who will take care of the day to day operations of a good HR department as this she does with ease, conviction and expertise.

She was a well respected and tireless advocate for Absolute Software and will make a great addition to any organization. To summarize, Denise is a highly capable, dedicated, hard working, HR executive and I highly recommend her. \r\n.

kjfuhrman;1;I first met KJ Fuhrman when he was an intern for the MuchMusic On-Air Promotion Department. He was very diligent and there was no task too big or small for him to undertake. He showed enthusiasm and meticulousness which earned him a role as a Production Coordinator for the Bell Media Agency. I can honestly say that KJ is one of the hardest working people you will ever meet. He is good at anticipating what is needed and his attention to detail is bar none. KJ also proves to be a talented Promo Producer as he had demonstrated time and time again with the on-air promos he has been assigned. He is truly an asset to any company. 
kjfuhrman;2;I had worked alongside KJ for close to five years. In that time, I've seen him not only excel at the core elements of his job, sourcing content and getting it to air in time, but also learn other tasks that extend well beyond the scope of his role, like inter-department coordination, release planning, and even championing his department's internal communication methodologies.\r\n\r\nThat is one of the things that is great about KJ. He demonstrates not only mastery for his core role, but also the ability to take on new projects that are both difficult and critical to the company and department's growth. In fact, his evolution of the agency media ingest best practices aligned with a sharp increase in agency deliverables to air.\r\n\r\nThis rare mix of productivity and ambition sets a great example for the rest of the team, and explains why everyone loves working with KJ. Including myself.

smorglobal;1;I met Shira at Columbia Business School. I was a novice researcher at the \u2018professional scholars\u2019 programme, meaning I really didn\u2019t know much about research. Shira was a PhD student at the time and was assigned to me as my mentor and supervisor. I seriously could not been more lucky! Shira was a fantastic mentor and teacher. She is super knowledgeable but also very patient and a lot of fun! Throughout my experience at Columbia, I was amazed by Shira\u2019s creativity and courage in how she approached problems. I believe these qualities make her such a truly outstanding scholar she has become. 
smorglobal;2;Shira is both a passionate and highly competent researcher and professor.

Further, Shira easily integrates research into her lectures, making them both relatable to her audience as well as comprehensible. She is very adaptable and can easily handle multiple projects and roles simultaneously. Finally, Shira's positive outlook and engagement makes her enjoyable to work with. In the time I have known Shira since 2010, she was my research mentor during her doctorate, and now, I work as her associate in her teaching position at Bentley College.

rebecca-sykes-b49a233;1;Rebecca Sykes is one of the most phenomenal teachers/mentors I have ever had.I had the great pleasure of studying yoga with her while she was an artist-in-residence at the University of Chicago and continued to study with her upon my graduation from the University.Rebecca's yoga classes are unique and memorable, because they are never just about moving through various physical poses, but they focus on building inner strength, cultivating compassion, and creating communities.She always has a theme to her class that she nicely weaves into the poses so her students are challenged to think about the meaning of their practice and can therefore engage with yoga in a deeper and more meaningful way.After her yoga classes at UChicago, Rebecca hosted conversation sessions with her students during which we explored big questions and shared our thoughts with each other -- that was a way of community-building stemming from a yoga context that I have never experienced before, and it was incredibly rewarding.I also have been lucky enough to have Rebecca as my mentor while I was a college student at UChicago.Her advise always came from the heart, and she was so willing to share her own experiences to guide me in decision-making.Rebecca has inspired me in innumerable ways, and I am envious of anyone who has the pleasure to work with her!

yuvalav;1;I had the pleasure to have Yuval In my team for 6 years, \r\nYuval is self-motivated, innovative and smart. He always showed great passion for challenges and was able to take ownership over complex assignments. \r\nYuval distinguished himself by consistently keeping up with new technologies and tools. He always looked for ways to add automation, improve our team\u2019s efficiency and accelerate time to tape-out.\r\nYuval always thought beyond the scope of our team. He was able to give constructive feedback to other teams in the company, and thus, reducing the cost and power of company\u2019s product.\r\nYuval is a great team player. He cooperates and learns from others. He is also ramping up quickly on new subjects.\r\nI am confident Yuval will devote himself to any position he may have with a high degree of diligence.\r\n
yuvalav;2;Yuval was my classmate during our E.E studies in the Technion.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the smartest people I know. He was the guy who understood, way before anyone else could, the most complex mathematical theories and would spend the time later explaining it, in manageable terms, to his classmates. \r\n\r\nOne thing Yuval always had, is a very goal oriented approach. He knew what he wanted, and how to get there. For example, he knew in which type of a company he wanted to work during School, and got accepted to work there before they usually take people during the degree. He is always very capable of managing his time by priorities: if it is important, it\u2019s a focus, if it\u2019s not he is not afraid to just \u2018drop it\u2019 \u2013 a quality which I find great and uncommon with our other classmate who kept trying to \u2018make all perfect\u2019 but for the lack of priorities, succeeded in none. \r\n\r\nYuval is also a great friend, and a pleasure to be around. I\u2019d feel really lucky if we had the chance to work or study together again \u2013 he is the type of person I can trust, and enjoy the company of.

mashalavrov;1;I had the pleasure of working with Maria when she was the project manager for deploying vital VPN desktop software to Intel\u2019s 120,000+ employees worldwide. The Intel IT project team was globally dispersed (she was in Israel, I in the U.S. on west coast). You can imagine the complexity. From the beginning I was impressed with Maria\u2019s professionalism, technical knowledge, and personable way of working with teammates. But what makes her a real standout is that she also has a strong grasp of marketing and the importance of user experience. This ability is unusual in engineering teams. She even put together an attractive comparison chart to help users switch from the old VPN product to the new one (something normally done by the marketing support). I can\u2019t say enough good things about Maria. She absolutely knows how to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical staff. She\u2019ll be an asset to whoever is smart enough to hire her!

hel%%D7%%95-dangur;1;I started working with Heli when she was involved in setting up a high-tech and startups workspace project for a large public international real estate firm. Heli was responsible for managing the project, including market research, creating strategic partnerships with companies in the field, and the logistical establishment of the complex. I have come to learn that Heli has an deppth understanding of business and marketing strategy, works in a pragmatic and at the same time creative, assertive and very determined manner. She manage to do all this while working well and pleasantly with people.\n\nWhenever an idea came up she was enthusiastic to run explore the market, creates partnerships in the target market and to recruit strategic partners in the target country. Somehow she managed to engage them all with a great motivation and energy to collaborate towards achieving her goal.\n\nBecause of our wonderful connection, Heli continued to work with me at StarTAU, the entrepreneurship center of Tel Aviv University, where she naturally integrated into the business development and external relations department. Her ability to create collaborations on a global level greatly contributed to the development of the center and to other members of our community.\nShe also made a huge organizational impact when she ran the international acceleration program, where she accompanied startups successfully with strategic planning, customers, and investors.\n\nHeli is a pure soul player with strategic thinking, creativity, management abilities and most importantly - a people person \nAs you all know, this impressive mix is not easy to find!\n\nI recommend anyone who wants to establish or manage an enterprise, incubator, accelerator to work with Heli.

issamshami;1;Many people cross path with you, but few reshape you. I crossed paths with Issam almost a decade ago when I started working in a local NGO that sought to foster coexistence between young Jews and Arabs who learned together IT and coding. . He served as a mentor, advancing my pedagogical skills, and equipping me with the required professional knowledge and skills. I was a complete novice, and Issam\u2019s enthusiasm, and support, prompted me to constantly improve myself. Issam was the backbone of the local NGO branch. He carried out the bulk of the heavy-duty organizational tasks, creating a clear structure, that kept us on track. His unwavering diligence, and steadfast commitment was exemplary, and was displayed especially in his interaction with the program\u2019s teenage participants. He seamlessly transitioned from firmness to leniency, providing the framework necessary for the acquisition of complicated IT skills and concepts, and at the same time tuning in to the social and emotional needs of his students. Issam is a fine conversationalist and deeply insightful, and the project manager of our local NGO, never took a step forward without consulting him. His loyalty, conscientiousness, and above all, remarkable people skills, will contribute greatly to whatever working environment he joins. 
issamshami;2;Issam and I attended a QA Automation Course and several makeathons that were organized by Tsofen.\n\nWe studied together a QA Automation Course in 2016, There I knew Issam as an outstanding participant that learns quickly and has Based knowledge from previous careers. He has added value to the participants of this course, supported all those who needed help and shared his skills with others.\nThe same leading skills were noticed during the several makeathons and hackathons that we took part in together. He listened carefully to team members' ideas and suggestions and then joined all actions needed to be done to success in our mission. Represented us clearly in these competitions and explained our vision successfully in front of the judging panel.\n\nIssam is a partner you would want to cooperate with for a long time.\n

alexander-rubinstein-6789955a;1;The purpose of this letter is to provide my strongest recommendation for Dr. Alexander Rubinstein as a professional in the field of biophysics and molecular modeling. \r\n\r\nI am an Professor at University of Nebraska at Omaha.I received my Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics 1993 from the Urals Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences in Yekaterinburg, Russia.I authored and coauthored more than 100 articles in refereed scientific journals. \r\n\r\nI know Alexander since June 2008, when he joined the Department of Physics, University of Nebraska at Omaha as a Research Associate Professor. His research was concentrating on various computational aspects of biophysics and biochemistry of proteins in aqueous solutions including the effects of protein-protein and protein-inorganic surface recognition, self-aggregation, functioning and structural protein stabilization. Alexander had been engaged in study of the 2D self-assembly of virus capsids on mica. Alexander proposed a phenomenological model for an elegant explanation of packing mechanism of the virus array on the basis of the steric and electrostatic complementarity ofvirus protein capsids interacting in solvent. \r\n\r\nAlexander research activity was focused on adequate evaluation of the electrostatic interactions at small inter-charge distances in vicinity of the macromolecule (protein)-solvent interface as a function of the solvent mesoscopic structure. He has developing non-local electrostatic approach (NLEA) to de-convolute this problem that remains a challenge in computational biological physics. \r\n\r\nDr. Rubinstein has applied NLEA to discuss the interactions between bio-molecules (proteins) and nanostructured surfaces of implants. He has shown that nanostructuring of the surface may not only lead to a stronger adhesive protein (fibronectin) adsorption on the surface, but also activate the protein and initiate the fibronectin matrix assembly, that plays the role of a scaffold for extracellular matrix formation in the process of cell-implant adhesion. \r\n\r\nAlexander is very creative person and always looks for the new way of approaching the problem. Alexander successfully combines his analytical and computational skills and applies them to studies of molecular mechanisms of biological and biotechnological processes.He has good communication skills. He has provided a major contribution to the preparation of grant proposals to NSF on the non local electrostatics in aqueous solution. He works great in team environment and he had organized collaborations with Kansas University and Akron University in his short stay at UNO. \r\n\r\nDr. Rubinstein has outstanding credentials and experience in university research. I believe that his abilities will be of great value for any place of his future employment.
alexander-rubinstein-6789955a;2;This is my special pleasure to recommend Dr. Alex Rubinstein as an expert in the field of Biophysics and molecular modeling of biological processes. \r\nI know Dr. Alexander Rubinstein since 2000 when I joined the Department of Bioinformatics and Molecular Modeling at the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center,Omaha,NE,the United States,where Alexander had been working. I recognized that the field he had been dealing with included the clarification of the structure-function relationship of proteins and peptides. I have been frequently impressed of high- level professional presentation by him during regular departmental and institutional meetings and conferences.His presentations on own original discoveries in the area of contribution of solvent microstructure effects to electrostatic interactions between proteins/peptides were always interesting. To my opinion, Dr. Rubinstein\u2019s pioneer studies always met understanding and high evaluation from his colleagues and experts in the same or related field. I frequently witnessed how his ideas and developmental models were further utilized to be incorporated in other related molecular models demonstrating the heuristic values of Alexander studies.In 2001-2007, these studies resulted in several excellent presentations at national. meetings as well as very interesting publications in refereed scientific journals.I was watchingreal interest from my colleagues to Dr. Rubinstein\u2019s studies particularly in the field of molecular mechanisms of amyloidogenic \u03b2-protein self-aggregation contributing to Alzheimer\u2019s disease development.\r\nThis was my real pleasure to professionally discuss with Alex Rubinstein the molecular mechanisms of peptide-peptide and protein-protein interactions within the real solvents, and I learned much from him since his strengths included competence, creativity, patience and infectious enthusiasm. Ability to combine biophysical and biochemical background to form a base for an explanation of any molecular mechanism of inter- and intraprotein interactions contributed to biological functions is a remarkable feature of him.\r\nI like his friendly personality and constant ability to listen and understand, learn and teach, discuss and explain when necessary. I am confident that Dr. Alexander Rubinstein is a valuable and creative scientist who might significantly contribute to the research working alone or as a member of a team.\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me at vpisarev@gmail.com if you may have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVladimir M.

alon-kanchuck;1;I led the rebrand of Techworx, the tech division of a hedge fund, an industry not known for technology innovation. We needed to show that we were innovative and creative, as we wanted to attract startup talent and people from Google and Facebook (when they were still cool). I chose Rami and Alon, along with RAG Studio because of my previous interaction with Rami. Without any guarantee of winning the business, they were diligent and professional, listening to my needs and proposing solutions. Even though they were many timezones away, they were always available, iterating with me through their very well structured design process. They weren't afraid to challenge my ideas and ultimately, we got the outcome we desired. They drove a wholesale redesign of the parent company's website, which is still in use years later. They are a valued partner and I would engage them for any future projects. \n

mickyoland;1;I've worked for Micky for 1.5 years, and in those years, I've seen him take on new responsibilities while having the time to teach this information back into his employees. \nBy being focused on the customer needs, on how each feature will serve its end user, checking, every step of the way, if what we defined is the right solution, looking to improve and make us better PMs, Micky pushed and set us example of how product manager should think and act. Micky is as great a person as he was a manager, and his next employer will be lucky to have him.
mickyoland;2;Micky is one of Actimize's cornerstones, it's hard to imagine the company without him. Micky is a natural born product manager, but due to his programming and management experience he has a rare holistic understanding of the entire gamut from client needs and strategic planning to the most technical and low level decisions and constraints. Micky managed to walk the thread and keep the product above all competition, and literally made it from a side-kick product to an industry standard, and a standalone flagship product for NICE Actimize.
