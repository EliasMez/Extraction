And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.Home Credit GroupHome Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\nShow moreShow less

Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival.One year ago, the office of the U.S. Vice President spearheaded a bold new initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, to make a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years.In 2017, the Data Science Bowl will be a critical milestone in support of the Cancer Moonshot by convening the data science and medical communities to develop lung cancer detection algorithms.Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.This year, the Data Science Bowl will award $1 million in prizes to those who observe the right patterns, ask the right questions, and in turn, create unprecedented impact around cancer screening care and prevention. The funds for the prize purse will be provided by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.\nShow moreShow less

They grew up in poverty with parents who are drug addicts, prisoners or otherwise disadvantaged. Some are orphans.  Students represent a range of religious and ethnic backgrounds including Arab and African countries. The children are mostly helpless and in need of a home, security and support.At Ohr Simcha, children benefit from a warm and loving, peaceful rural environment and a team of dedicated and experienced staff. Teachers give children attention and warmth, and do everything they can to provide the children a balanced education and strong socio-cultural values. Thanks to the devoted care, personal attention and assistance they receive in the school, children are able to develop, recover and move forward as productive members of society.
