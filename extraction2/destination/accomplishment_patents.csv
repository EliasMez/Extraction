%7Ekevinwen;1;;United States;24-05-2016;Techniques are described for tracking and recognizing gestures performed within a field-of-view of a sensor. In one or more implementations, the techniques may be implemented within an electronic device that is configured to receive a signal from a sensor in response to the sensor detecting a gesture occurring within a field of view of the sensor. A lens is positioned over the sensor to collimate light incident on the lens and to pass the collimated light to the sensor. The electronic device is configured to generate one or more light intensity ratios based upon the signal. The electronic device is then configured to determine a type of gesture performed based upon the one or more light intensity ratios.;9348462 B2;9348462 B2;https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e9/05/89/996c25e45d2944/US9348462.pdf

aashishmittal;1;;in;null;The present invention is an intelligent technical system for providing effective counseling to students to increase their academic motivation and career engagement, to help reduce school dropouts and enhance workforce productivity in developing economies. The system employs Artificial Intelligence and Data-Mining to perform the key functions of psychology assessment, applying counseling methodologies, connecting student to relevant opportunities, etc., and uses Gamification techniques to make the process highly engaging and adaptive for young students. The system performs thorough profile building of the user by accounting external data such as student\u2019s performance in school, involvement in various activities, student\u2019s background history, and internal data retrieved through student\u2019s interaction with the system, such as the student\u2019s psychological assessment, identification of education inhibitors, evaluation of personal interests and skills, match of student skills with different career options, etc. Based on student\u2019s profile, the system applies various motivation techniques and conveys related information which would help user take more informed decisions to achieve their goals. The system employs various methods for maintaining efficient and long-lasting user engagement with the system, including Gamification and native-language based interaction for conveying the data. It also performs feedback provision and goal-setting for the student to make outcomes tangible, and consolidates data from multiple students for getting insights into the high-level trends and metrics in student engagement with academics, which can be shared with interested parties such as NGOs and government departments for broader investigations and actions.;null;null;null

A reference address is sent from the first remote computer to the local computer via the network through execution of code by the syscall server. A syscall request is built in the local computer with arguments determined using the reference address received from the first remote computer. The syscall request is sent from the local computer to the first remote computer via the network. The syscall request is copied into a stack of the first remote computer through execution of code by the syscall server. Registers are popped from the syscall request in the stack. Execution of a syscall request is initiated on the first remote computer. The result of the syscall request is pushed onto the stack.

Unfortunately, the sheer volume of video data and the difficulty of identifying relevant portions of the video data often thwart such attempts. In some cases, adequate tools may exist to perform an analysis, but the analysis is only tractable when performed on a handful of image frames. If the tools were applied to entire videos, it would take far too long to receive the results. Furthermore, some tools are more suitable in some contexts than others.

Once printed, negotiable certificates of insurance are sold from shipper to shipper as cargo is transferred on the way to its destination, without the insurer's involvement.What if the need for the special paper, its printing, delivery, tracking, storage, and protection could be eliminated?What if you could safely buy a ticket printed on plain paper from a scalper in a venue's parking lot with total confidence that it was valid for the event and seat as described? Even if there is no wireless access?The invention described herein utilizes a universally known and accepted unique item that is independently identifiable and valuable so as to be constituted for difficulty of counterfeiting as an authenticator item. The identity of this item is included in an authorization calculation which can only be accomplished by an authorizing issuing authority. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the authenticator is a serial numbered item such as a currency bill or note. The document may be created in a decentralized fashion using ordinary plain paper and the document may even take electronic or other forms. The issuing authority must have the critical or important details of the document and must authorize the creation of the document before it can be created. Further the document's authenticity may be verified without communication back to the issuing authority.;2008 US 7,353,398 and 2010 US 7,818,812;2008 US 7,353,398 and 2010 US 7,818,812;http://dev.patents.com/pdf-7818812.html

nuriel-amir-1776374;1;;United States;01-10-2013;Method and systems provide growth of polymer structures at a high rate in a selective manner. In various embodiments, the method or system can expose the growth site to a polymer source and growing a polymer tube at a rate of at least 80 micrometer per hour at the growth site. The method or system can provide selectivity by providing a growth site on a substrate by patterning a metal, such as copper, that provides a seed site for the polymer. Non-selected sites can be coated with a polymer growth inhibitor, such as polyimide or silicon nitride.;US 08569103;US 08569103;null

nuriel-amir-1776374;4;;United States;01-11-2013;The disclosure is directed to designing and using an overlay target with orthogonal underlayer dummyfill. According to various embodiments, an overlay target may include one or more segmented overlay pattern elements forming at least one overlay target structure. The overlay target may further include one or more inactive pattern elements forming at least one dummyfill target structure. Each of the one or more inactive pattern elements may include dummyfill segmented along an axis orthogonal to a segmentation axis of at least one proximately disposed overlay pattern element. In some embodiments, each of the target structures or layers may be formed from a separate process layer successively disposed upon a substrate, such as a silicon wafer. In some embodiments, the overlay and dummyfill target structures may be twofold or fourfold rotationally symmetric to allow for certain manufacturing or metrology advantages.;null;null;null
