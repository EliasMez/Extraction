%7Ekatywong;1;01-08-2019;31-05-2020;Developing DIY Potentiostat for Industrial Electrochemical Applications;For our senior design capstone project, we were tasked and received sponsorship by Reactwell, a local hard science & engineering startup headquartered in New Orleans, to create a do-it-yourself (DIY) potentiostat for industrial applications. Potentiostats are electrical apparatuses that apply and control the voltage between two points. These devices are essential in electrochemistry and very important for testing batteries and catalysts since they are just electrochemical reactions. Our potentiostat would help with: (1) creating affordable potentiostats with the same quality that are much less than $10,000(<$1000) (2) one of ReactWell's project which is to abate greenhouse gas emissions by finding economic and productive use cases that incentivize the capture, conversion and utilization of carbon dioxide gas, resulting in a net zero carbon world. We were able to meet our sponsor's benchmarks and create a functional one-channel potentiostat prototype.;http://www.electricelks.com

This literature focuses on developing and solving a stochastic programming model to classify noisily labeled data instead of applying the existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithms directly. Because classifying the noisily labeled data by using existing multiple kernel learning algorithms often leads to suboptimal performance due to the incorrect class assignments. The key idea of this literature is to introduce a binary random variable for each training data to indicate whether the class label of the data is correct or not so that they can turn the deterministic constraint in MKL into chance constraint which leading to a stochastic programming model.;null
%7Epxhan;2;01-12-2013;null;"Implement machine learning algorithms in the course \""Machine Learning Algorithms\";In this project, support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost were implemented in R and MATLAB for building classification models on a highly unbalanced data set, where the number of negative samples is roughly 18 times larger than that of positive samples. Traditional criterion such as overall misclassification rate does not work in this case since the performance of positive classification might be overshadowed. To handle the unbalance, the product of number of true positive and that of true negative is used to serve as the criterion of cross validation, in return of a much more balanced classification performance despite a slight increase in overall misclassification rate.;null

aaronncl;1;;null;Creating a SketchUp Model of Singapore Polytechnic(SP) and Performing Fire Simulations on the Buildings.;Due to the maturity of MAE blocks, fire safety, evacuation routes and 3D models are either outdated or lacking. Fire simulations and evacuation patterns are therefore studied to validate the safety of the MAE buildings in accordance with the SCDF guidelines. The results are also matched against an actual fire evacuation drill to confirm its accuracy. \n\nThe simulations and studies are done through recognized programs such as PyroSim, FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) and Pathfinder which are all approved by the SCDF. These programs allow users to set appropriate boundaries in exchange for a more accurate simulant. \n\nThis project heavily relies on detailed models either drawn by code or an external CAD program for importation in the simulation software. Generally in the industry, models are mostly drawn with codes using Notepad++ that generates simpler, less detailed models. Refining this area of workflow, most of the models of the MAE blocks are drawn via SketchUp for the project and not code. \n\nThis allows for a more detailed model compared to a coded drawn model, which provides more accuracy in the simulation results.\n\nThe viability of 3D printing in replacing the conventional methods of creating a physical model is also within the group\u2019s research. By creating a physical 3D model coupled with some effects, better illustration towards the target audience can be offered, giving them a better understanding of the project.\n\nIn addition, by optimizing the project workflow it allows the group to meet the datelines and set aside time for drawing and simulations. This new innovative method will allow a simpler process, while at the same time, accomplish a more detailed and accurate result. The 3D Models of the blocks will not only be used for the current simulations. It will also be used for future energy modelling under IES (Integrated Energy Simulation).\n\nTo summarise, this project will therefore testify to the fire safety and evacuation of the outdated MAE blocks.;null

In this paper we solely focus on Real Estate from an Investors/Buyers point of view, by surveying all the possible variables that affect the property pricing in city of Ames, Iowa. Price negotiations are influenced not just by the number of rooms or the location of the property but several other factors and in this paper, we explore 79 variables that describe almost every aspect of a house in Ames, Iowa.By using multi variable Linear Regression and regressing these 79 variables with the sales prices of the property, we identified 12 variables which are significant and play a crucial role in determining the price of a typical property in Ames. We further analyze the intercepts and coefficients for these significant factors to study how they vary with the sales price, e.g. How the zone in which the property is built e.g. Agricultural, Commercial, High Density etc. affect sale price of the property.Tools: JMP Pro, Multi-linear Regression;https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1Jk6dHzj5DQmeP

I was one of the two lead organisers of the event, and this two-day long youth conference was incredibly special to me. This is because, being a female Indian student in Singapore in the 21st century, I personally related to all of the topics that we had chosen: Identity, Equality, Education, and Mental Health. To be able to resolve an issue, we need to take collective action, and to do that, it is crucial that the issue is first discussed in great length. The youth today faces challenges that haven\u2019t been discussed openly in the past, which may make one feel alone, or like their voice isn\u2019t being heard by the people around them. As a result, despite being together, we often feel alone. Lilac Parity gave students a platform to talk about these issues, about themselves, as well as other people, without the fear of judgement. The conference also gave participants the chance to work together to propose solutions to these issues, that we can apply to our daily lives, to eventually make the world a better place for all of us. By the end of this conference, I had learnt the importance of conversation, no matter how short. Often beginning a conference session with a personal anecdote,I realised that all it took for people to discuss their feelings and opinions was one person\u2019s initiative. After receiving feedback from the participants, I was happy that we were able to provide a space where people could discuss their feelings and opinions, and realise that they weren\u2019t alone in what they were facing,which makes dealing with a problem much easier in the long run.These two days were extremely enriching, satisfying and in many ways, cathartic for me, personally. I came out of the conference, much more settled, aware & empathetic, with takeaways that would hold me in good stead in my life to come.\nShow moreShow less;"https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flilacparity2019%2Ewordpress%2Ecom%2Fabout-lilac-parity%2F&amp;urlhash=IKt2&trk=public_profile_project-title"

The system also offers Update, Renewal and Termination services for 65 licences.Features include    Search for the licences that they may need    Apply for multiple licences at once using the integrated form    Update particulars on existing licence    Renew existing licences that are expiring soon    Terminate licences that are no longer required    Pay for multiple licences via one consolidated transactionAchievementsAs of 1 October 2005, the average license processing time for all new applications including those not handled by OBLS was reduced from 21 to 8 days as a result of the reengineering exercise and OBLS implementation. 85 licenses were processed in less than a week. Of these, 43 were processed in less than three days. Based on the cost-benefit analysis done at 31 Dec 2006, businesses have benefited from the OBLS project with an estimated cost savings of US$27 million (since the pilot launch in Jan 2004). The cost savings were derived from the reduction in the amount of license fees, reduction in the processing time of licenses and the time-savings by businessmen who now do not need to travel and queue up physically and complete multiple application forms that ask for similar information. Businessmen have given the OBLS an 80% positive feedback rating.;https://licences.business.gov.sg/

Characterising different sizes of colorectal polyps requires comparing CT images to reference images from a similar region of the human body. We propose a new system for the computer aided differentiation of colorectal polyps using localised texture extraction algorithms applied to CT scans. Currently, the investigated methods of Discrete Contourlet Transform (DCoT), Discrete Curvelet Transform (DCuT), Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST), Double Density Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DDDT-CWT), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in this study has managed to successfully achieve an accuracy of 95.6%, 91.7%, 87%, 47.23%, 46.67%, 50.6% and 62.2% for a 10-fold cross validation benchmark between different sizes of colorectal polyps.  \nShow moreShow less;null

An early diagnosis of CAD would allow early prophylaxis before the onset of more severe symptoms or even a complete myocardial infraction (heart attack). In an ECG of an individual with CAD, the elevated T wave profile is the most characteristic. However, there are also other anomalies in the ECG that is more difficult to detect by eye. A set of algorithms was developed to automatically diagnose individuals with CAD using these symptoms as well as others defined from ECGs. Multiple samples of diseased ECGs were obtained from the St Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics (INCART) Database. Using MATLAB, the ECGs are prepared for further processing by de-noising and de-trending using Wavelet Transform and Gaussian filters. Next, various features of the ECGs are extracted using existing and newly developed techniques. The features obtained are then cross-sampled with healthy controls ECGs, which were obtained from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) Database, and are validated by the Student\u2019s T-Test. Clinically significant features were then selected and fed into the Weka data-mining software suite. Through experimentation, it is concluded that the neural network was the most accurate classifier. The final neural network classifier is able to diagnose CAD with an accuracy of 91.8% across 37,734 samples.\nShow moreShow less;null

aaronyap;1;01-08-2013;30-09-2013;And the World Goes Round;This version of And the World Goes Round is given a circusy overtone to give the feeling of contrast between showbiz and harsh reality of life. As such, the stage is set up like a circus tent, with audience seatings on three sides of a circular performance area. This is a relatively simple set (in theory), which allows more room for lighting to expand its full potential to create better dramatic effect.In terms of costuming, the costume styles of the cast members include some circusy pieces like the ringmaster\u2019s jacket, sexy corsets and bustles and flamboyant jackets. However, not all the numbers in this musical revue are circusy in mood, so basic blacks are used in songs that are more sentimental.;http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-AtWGR.php

Like in the previous two installments, the backdrop is painted in bright colours and bold strokes to give the ballet a child-like ambience. This time round, however, special emphasis is also placed on intricacy on details; the backdrop is heavily decked with plants, trees and flowers, some in exaggerated proportions, to bring out the enchanting atmosphere of the forest.As some of the characters in this third installment are recurring characters from the first, the costume design maintains the same fantasy look as in the first installment for the non-human characters: juxtaposition of modern elements with fantasy motifs.";http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-PnBBP.php

It is relatively sitcom-ish, and to go with this style, bright and colourful yet elegant furniture pieces were used in juxtaposition with clean white walls and decorations. The idea is to let the action comes alive with the actors and the furniture pieces they use, while letting the walls fade into the background.;http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-SBB.php
aaronyap;4;01-08-2012;30-09-2012;Attempts on Her Life;\u201cAttempts on Her Life\u201d is an unique script which can have limitless ways of interpretation and presentation. For this version, Anne/ Annie/Anya/ Anuskha is \u201cobjectified\u201d as the essence of humanity. She existed as a lover in one scene, a terrorist in later on and a car in another. Her omnipresence is like the godly figures in many religions that has different manifestations.The set aims to evoke the sense of paying homage to humanity. A pool similar to a ritual pool is set in the middle of the space where gospel-like text are narrated by the actors. Fluorescent tubes are hung over the pool, mostly unlit in the beginning when Anne is still in disjointed state, get lighted up together in the finale when the picture of Anne finally gets pieced together.;http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-AoHL.php

As this ballet is staged in a black box theatre, the set only consists of a single, non-representational and whimsically painted backdrop that gives a clue of what the ballet is about. For the costumes, folk silhouettes and ethnic/ national colours are employed to make characters of different countries appear more distinct from each other visually.;http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-PnBGAtW.php
aaronyap;6;01-06-2011;31-12-2011;The Nutcracker;"Set in around 1910s Shanghai, the set has to look distinctively Chinese for the \u201creal life\u201d scenes, but still retain the classical fantasy feel for the \u201cdream\u201d scenes. To achieve a cohesive look, some elements are repeatedly used in the various scenes. For example, the legs, which are painted with straight bold lines with some gradation, remains on stage throughout the ballet. During Act 1 scene 1, they represent the Art Deco design on the house interior; in scene 2, they become the trunks of tall pine trees when borders painted with non-realistic snowy leaves are being used, matching with the feel of the pine trees painted in the backdrop; in Act 2, these legs becomes pillars in the Palace of Sweets";http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-Nutcracker.php
aaronyap;7;01-01-2011;30-04-2011;Big Love;Based on the concept of \u201cBaroque\u201d and the director\u2019s vision of a clean space is this \u201cwhite box\u201d that utilised almost the entire black box theatre from wall to wall. Instead of the usual ornate decorations one usually identifies \u201cBaroque\u201d with, the set goes for maximum dramatisation while trying to be minimalistic at the same time.Almost the entire theatre is painted white, with the exception of a small corner of a wall at upstage right that is painted with an artwork that is not meant to be instantly recognisable, but when looked at closely, one will realise that it is a superimposed map of Italy and Greece. The brides ran away from Greece, a territorially well defined-country, to Italy, another territorially well-defined country, to get away from their prospective husbands. However, while they ran away from their marriage, they could not run away from their fate, and hence this superimposed map is an abstract representation of the blurred world they are in: they may have fled to Italy to seek asylum, but the feeling is still very Greece (still oppressed by their prospective husbands like back in Greece), so are they still in Greece or already in Italy, or in a mysterious \u201cGreetaly\u201d?;http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-BigLove.php
aaronyap;8;01-07-2010;30-11-2010;The Maids;"This version of \""The Maids\"" is performed in 2 acts, one act performed by an all-male cast and another performed by an all-female cast, While the plot for both acts are exactly the same, they are interpreted differently by the different cast, and both interpretations are acted out in different settings; the location for the male cast is set in a temporary office in a construction site whereas the female cast sets their version in a cheap hotel. Both settings have some common themes: claustrophobic spaces, play-acting and voyeurism. In order to achieve a cohesive look for the set, unifying elements that represent these common themes were use. The tight acting space (partitioned out of the black box theatre with rostrums and flats) suggested claustrophobia, the usage of live video-feed suggested play-acting and vertical blinds that opens and closes during segments of the play suggested voyeurism.";http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-Maids.php

aaronyap;10;01-02-2010;31-05-2010;Peter and Blue's Forest Adventure;Peter and Blue's Forest Adventure is a ballet targeted for children. As such, the set is to look whimsical and fantasy-like to cater to the young audience. Everything in the set do not look anything realistic: from backdrop to painted borders and legs and even props. Every part of the set has an unreal, cartoonish quality, and together with the bright colour scheme used, enhances the fairytale quality of the ballet.As a ballet targeted for children, the costumes should evoke the impression of whatever the characters are without being too literal. Some \u201cmodern\u201d elements are added to the design of the costumes as a juxtaposition, like the waistcoat and knee-length trousers (60s-70s look) for the general silhouette for the \u201cfantasy\u201d male characters and regular dresses for their female equivalent.;http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-PnBFA.php

As such, scenery is kept minimal that consists of 4 pieces of translucent cloth and a platform that are permanently set on stage. While the platform gives a suggestion of hierarchy among the different characters on stage, the 4 pieces of cloth, being upright yet flimsy, represents the four basic virtues in Chinese culture:loyalty, piety, morality and uprightness. These virtues may have been strongly emphasised and enforced in ancient China, but in this play, they are being ignored became transparent to the characters in the story as they started to execute things against these virtues in pursue of their own material well-being.";http://aaronyapdesign.net/portfolio-BitIP.php

The project investigated the efficacy of current dispersal techniques employed in the fabrication of carbon nanotube(CNT)/ABS composites via solvent casting. Midway through the project, the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted lab access and resulted in lack of experimental work. However, the scope of the project was meaningfully shifted to computational studies in the form of computational fluid dynamics, analytical models, and numerical simulations.;null

A thorough review of literature was conducted and further insight was obtained from the primary researcher\u2019s engagement with the six stages of the heuristic research methodology. Additional viewpoints were obtained from in-depth conversational interviews with two co-researchers about their respective experiences of providing and receiving movement-based supervision in DMT as a supervisor and supervisee. The three core themes that were identified include: the role and importance of movement, challenges to using movement, and the significance of supervisory roles and the use of movement in the supervisory relationship. The research process culminated with the creative synthesis in which the primary researcher engaged in a video-recorded, movement-based improvisation.  \nShow moreShow less;null

daniel-mombourquette-msc-a17a104a;1;01-11-2011;31-03-2012;A Political Ecology Assessment of How the Small versus Large-Scale Fisheries Discourse Has Evolved in Atlantic Canada.;"Poster Presentation:A political ecology (PE) analysis was conducted to critically assess: (a) how small and large-scale fishing practices in Atlantic Canada have developed over time, (b) the social discourse that has erupted between the stakeholders involved in each of the aforementioned industry sectors and (c) the mechanisms that have attributed to this unrest. The methodology presented a narrative that socio-economic mechanism such as state control, large corporate interests and global market forces have all attributed to the instability of fisheries resources, the decline and marginalization of SSF operations and to the erosion of many local/moral economies. As a result, the academic, international and institutional communities have been advocating on behalf of SSF practices as they have shown evidence of having a reduced impact on fisheries and ocean resources. The primary advocacy initiative being the Too Big to Ignore: Small-Scale Fisheries Global Research Network (TBTI). Consequently, the TBTI and author detail that the promotion of SSF practices have the ability to reclaim the vibrancy of fish stocks and the local communities these resources support. Because of this, SSF practices should be recognized as possible remedies to the above tribulations and thus be integrated into future management strategies. These SSF management solutions should also integrate, and be developed collectively by, the interests of all stakeholder groups (businesses, governments, local communities and the scientific, academic and institutional communities). Management strategies should also adhere to the precautionary principle; where strategies err on the side of caution in the face of any scientific uncertainty. These ethics thus become pertinent: if future integrated management strategies are successful, they could have the desired effect of allowing fisheries resources to be harvested for generations.";http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?fbid=3327097823792&set=a.2167589636812.2125469.1458813787&type=1&theater

harsh-solanki-19292b110;2;01-09-2014;30-04-2015;Exhaust Air Jack;If you have ever had to change a tire, you might consider the exhaust air jack a dream come true. These automotive gadgets make the task of lifting a car off the ground far less painful and awkward simply by letting the car's own exhaust do the dirty work.Traditional portable jacks, like the ones that come with your car, can be intimidating to the uninitiated. They have to be placed at a certain point on the chassis for safety, then fitted with a bar for leverage and cranked up, and up, and up. It takes a bit of strength and a lot of patience -- qualities most drivers find in short supply when a tire goes flat.The exhaust air jack lifts a vehicle using exhaust gas coming from the tailpipe. A hose attaches from the exhaust to a big sack placed under the car. The air coming out of the pipe fills the bag and quick. The car lifts off the ground.These gadgets stay inflated for sufficient time, though you should keep in mind that your car will be idling and using gasoline that entire time. Exhaust jacks deflate in few seconds when the job is finished, and its material folds up to fit in your car until you need it again.;null

By utilizing a patient's BMD data, we are able to train a model to predict whether or not the patient has normal bone density, low bone density, or osteoporosis. Models are written in Python and utilize a supervised learning approach meaning that training examples are labeled before they are put through the algorithm. Four different models were tested, two deep learning neural networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost. This was a great learning experience as I will be able to apply the same principles in other diagnostic or classification based machine learning algorithms.;null

sunbal-cheema-52912623;1;01-01-2010;31-12-2011;RFID Based Smart Shopping Cart;Over the past couple of decades, goods passing through the supply chain have been traced via bar codes. However, bar code technology has a number of limitations and does not meet today\u2018s needs for several reasons.Designed a Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) based Smart Shopping Cart that did purchase inventory in real-time and allowed automated point of sale (POS) check out. The solution allowed the shopper to know the value of what they purchased and increased the speed of check out time. The ability to add mobile and advertising applications was planned for phase II of the solution development. Utilized UHF EPC Gen2 protocol Tags tagging products with their unique ids. They were decoded using 18000 C UHF protocol. The decoded information was used to calculate the transaction total of all purchases in the range of the UHF reader and the interface developed on the Touch Screen was used to show proper information.;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jyq2rScnfwUFVOaDJQY0dfb2s/edit?usp=sharing

fcharih;1;01-01-2016;null;Radial-Flow Moving Bed Reactor Simulator;Our Capstone Plant Design Project involved a simulation of a aromatics production plant (benzene, toluene, xylenes). Given that Honeywell's UniSim built-in reactors could not handle the complexity of the reaction scheme, a custom solution needed to be developed.An extension was developed and implemented in C++  to allow for accurate simulation of the reaction system.;null
fcharih;2;01-05-2014;null;Structural Insights into the DNA Binding Activity of the Ferric Uptake Regulator in Campylobacter jejuni;Campylobacteriosis is among the leading causes of diarrheal illnesses in humans and is linked to the pathogenesis of debilitating autoimmune disorders. Campylobacter jejuni, the major etiological factor causing campylobacteriosis, must cope with the variable bioavailability of iron in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and maintain appropriate iron homeostasis to survive and proliferate, as excessive iron concentrations promote the synthesis of deleterious reactive oxygen species. The transcription factor Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) acts as a sensor and regulator of intracellular iron content, and activates or represses the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis as well as oxidative stress response. Evidence shows that the iron-free (apo) and iron-loaded (holo) forms of Fur generally interact with different DNA motifs in the promoters of Fur-regulated genes. Our previous structural studies have shown that apo-CjFur forms a V-shaped dimer, and that each monomer comprises a DNA binding domain (DBD) and a dimerization domain (DD) connected by a hinge region. We hypothesized that the binding of an iron atom in a regulatory metal binding site triggers a reorientation of DBD primarily mediated by a rearrangement of the hinge region to extend the CjFur regulon. We engaged in structural studies to investigate the mechanisms involved in the specificity of the apo and holo forms towards their respective DNA targets. We solved the crystal structure of a new apo-CjFur construct at a 1.8\u00c5 resolution. Overall, our findings provide further evidence towards the existence of the apo form of CjFur and provide useful data for drug design applications.;null

asch72;1;01-08-2015;31-12-2015;SEL-787 Transformer Protection Relay;Our final project team chose to work with a SEL-787 transformer protection relay as our final project. Our group wanted to understand how this relay communicated and functioned. We successfully created two labs for future students to work with this piece of equipment. The first lab would test the over-current element of the relay. The second lab would test the differential element of the relay. Before we could create and test the two labs we had to research, test and understand how this specific piece of equipment functioned as none of our group members had previous experience working with this relay.We used the knowledge gained through the Electrical Engineering Technology program to design a new faceplate, wire the relay enclosure, communicate between a computer and the relay, and to test and troubleshoot to gain understanding to create the labs. We performed a series of simple voltage and current tests to verify the relay was reading the correct values. We then tested the relay using the over-current and differential elements. The safety of equipment and personnel was a priority through the entire project. We kept the workspace tidy and free of tripping hazards. We wore the appropriate personal protective equipment when working with the equipment.We completed our project on time and under budget even with problems that we encountered through the 14 week period. We had problems establishing communication between the computer and relay. We also had issues understanding how the differential function operated. Our main conclusion was that the SEL-787 is a complex piece of equipment and in the time period we were given we could not fully explore all its possible settings and functions. We have recommendations for future students who use the labs we created or work with the SEL-787 in the future. We recommended students are currently taking the course Power Systems 2 and have already learned about protective relays before working with the SEL-787.;null

Part of the Toronto District School Board, OSF is run by teacher Craig Morrison. Craig believes that real-life, hands-on experience is far more valuable to these students than theory-based learning. Since their inception 7 years ago, OSF has seen a 95-100%% pass rate per semester, which is an exceptional success rate for students who may otherwise not have earned their high school education.Learn more on their blog: http://oasisskateboardfactory.blogspot.ca/The Anomaly/OSF PartnershipThe Anomaly/OSF partnership is an innovative business program that began in September 2013. Through mentorship and collaboration, students work with the team at Anomaly to create and build their own, unique skateboard brands. Each semester, students visit the Anomaly office on a monthly basis, where they meet one-on-one with mentors to collaborate and craft their brand vision, logo, and merchandising/marketing strategy. The students then take this information away and build their own branded skateboards/longboards/miniboards and accompanying merchandise (such as tees, stickers and patches).About the Pop-Up ShopThe annual event, titled \u201cThe Youth are Revolting: A Pop-Up Shop\u201d, marks the official public launch of the 2016 OSF student brands. Each student will be showcasing (and selling) their uniquely branded skateboards and accompanying merch. The event will also feature the release of a shop deck collaboration with renowned illustrator Kevin Lyons. Admission is free. Merchandise can be purchased with cash only.;null

These overhauls began due to an issue with our ventilation hood system in our kitchen which would result in the removal a kitchen fryer unit.Realizing that we could not produce the same output we choose to use this setback as a means for re-costing and designing out menu mix, layout and design. The menus themselves now look more modern, and are better suited for our concept. They have been very successful with reducing chit time averages from 22 minutes to 18 minutes during a full service. This reprint increased our food margins and allowed us to remove any slow moving items. This was a great team project to be involved with. We also managed to get a third party supplier to cover the costs of all design and print.;http://irishembassypub.com/menus/IEP_menus_dinner.pdf

In order to advertise this we decided to create a giant banner that would suit and complement the beautiful heritage building that the restaurant is located in. The cost for this form of advertising medium was substantial so I contacted and worked closely with a number of our suppliers and tapped into marketing budgets for strategic products. By working with our supplier\u2019s and their \u2018key portfolio products\u2019 I managed to not only get the banner completed within a narrow timeframe and fully paid for but I also managed to get all of our St. Patrick\u2019s Day entertainment covered.

This had a dramatic effect on our cost of goods analysis and highlighed many items in our existing mix that needed to be increased or removed.Our new excel based systems together with a sales anlaysis allowed us to achieve a very accurate picture of the health of our menu over the previous five years. With the updated systems we were able to make very educated decisions regarding content and direction. More importantly it added a huge return onto our bottom line.

shannon-sisk-094152181;1;01-09-2018;30-04-2020;Exploring Youth Sport Specialization from an Occupational Perspective;Sport specialization is referred to as year-round sport-specific training, participation on multipleteams of the same sport, and focused participation in a single sport occurring all year-round. Single-sport specialization is a rising trend in youth sports as a means of optimizing athletic performance but may be associated with various adverse outcomes such as overuse injuries, burnout, social isolation, and occupational imbalance. This scoping review offers a new perspective on youth single-sport specialization by exploring existing literature from an occupational perspective to examine how the phenomenon impacts occupational development by influencing engagement and performance. This is accomplished by the identification of emerging themes in the existing literature and linking these themes to the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement.;null

This project pertained to the case of a 16 year old male football player who had surgical repair of the syndesmosis as a result of tibiafibular diastasis occurring concurrently with a syndesmotic sprain. The patient underwent surgical repair of the syndesmosis which utilized the Anthrex Knotless Syndesmosis TightRope\u00ae Implant System. Following surgery, a post-operative syndesmotic repair rehabilitation program was initiated.This case study is unique as syndesmotic sprains rarely require surgical intervention especially without the presence of a fracture. Although it is rare for a syndesmotic injury to require surgery, those that do can be treated utilizing a tightrope approach despite the lack of a true accelerated protocol in the case of a paediatric patient.;null

badaljohry;1;01-04-2015;null;Survey on Perception of Investor;"\""Survey on Perception of Investor\"" has completed on concept of Behavioral finance. Extreme volatility has plagued financial markets worldwide since the 2008 Global Crisis. Investor sentiment has been one of the key determinants of market movements. In this context, studying the role played by emotions like fear, greed and anticipation, in shaping up investment decisions seemed important. Behavioral Finance is an evolving field that studies how psychological factors affect decision making under uncertainty. This thesis seeks to find the influence of certain identified behavioral finance concepts (or biases), namely, Overconfidence, Representativeness, Herding, Anchoring, Cognitive Dissonance, Regret Aversion, Gamblers\u2019 Fallacy, Mental Accounting, and Hindsight Bias, on the decision making process of individual investors in the Indian Stock Market. Primary data for analysis was gathered by distributing a structured questionnaire among investors who were categorized as (i) young, and (ii) experienced. Results obtained by analyzing a sample of 50 respondents, out of which 50 admitted to having suffered a loss of at least 30%% because of the crisis, revealed that the degree of exposure to the biases separated the behavioral pattern of young and experienced investors. Gamblers\u2019 Fallacy, Anchoring and Hindsight biases were seen to affect the young investors significantly more than experienced investors.";null

ASHRAE recommends that the team for the ISBD consist of at least three members with education covering architecture/construction, mechanical (HVAC) engineering, and electrical engineering.These multidisciplinary teams will be expected to design an energy efficient sustainable project approaching a \u201cZero Energy\u201d building with minimized energy demands for HVAC and all other technical systems that could be satisfied with locally available and/or building installed Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Students will be asked to satisfy ASHRAE Standard 189.1-2011 and then implement RES to approach \u201cZero Energy\u201d if possible.The fundamental goal of this design competition category is to encourage students to obtain experience in the ISBD process. Architects and engineers should work together from the very beginning to determine building orientation, layout, materials, mechanical systems, and electrical systems that meet the client\u2019s needs and work with the surrounding environment to minimize energy consumption. Additionally, special attention should be given to sustainability, the needs of the future shall be as (or more) important as the needs of the present when designing the building layout and integral systems. The judging criteria will be centered on ASHRAE Standard 189.1-2011; thus, areas of judging shall include Site Sustainability, Water Use Efficiency, Energy Efficiency, Indoor Environmental Quality, the Building\u2019s Impact on Atmosphere-Materials-Resources, and Construction and Plans for Operation";null

This novel study seeks to examine the effects of chronic corticosterone (CORT) elevation and the morphological alterations incurred on the myelination of the adult zebra finch song system. It is hypothesized that chronic physiological dosage of CORT will decrease the myelinated projections in the HVC and RA of the zebra finch song control system. Adult male zebra finches were sorted into a control group and a CORT group where they were treated for twenty-six days. Using immunohistochemical techniques, Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) will be used as a marker of oligodendrocytes to indicate myelination of in the song control system. The percentage of MBP marked structures will be quantified. Some limitations included the lack of specificity for the MBP marker and CORT treatment. Furthermore, there is a lack of research in this area. Future studies should look at ways to better quantify myelin and look to add to the body of literature on how stress and birdsong interact at the cellular level.;null

gabrielle-bouchard-52481369;1;01-02-2013;28-02-2013;La Foire en art actuel de Qu\u00e9bec;Cette initiative a comme objectif de promouvoir l\u2019achat d\u2019\u0153uvres d\u2019artistes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec tout en permettant \u00e0 ces derniers de conserver la majorit\u00e9 de la valeur de leur travail. Elle a pour but de rendre l\u2019acquisition des \u0153uvres un plaisir esth\u00e9tique et humain par la rencontre de l\u2019acheteur et de l\u2019artiste. Par sa structure innovante, la Foire a pour objectif de pr\u00e9senter une alternative \u00e0 certains circuits du march\u00e9 de l\u2019art o\u00f9 les jeunes artistes ne sont que tr\u00e8s rarement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les galeries commerciales. L\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nement se veut donc un nouveau mod\u00e8le, entre la galerie priv\u00e9e et le centre d\u2019artistes, qui souhaite d\u00e9mocratiser et populariser l\u2019achat d\u2019\u0153uvres d\u2019art;http://foireartactuel.com/

It is insulated from the inside with Enermax cellulose boards with an aluminum reflecting finish for light scavenging.The plc controls the lighting times, the \""shaking fan\"" time for shaking the plants, the greenhouse venting time, the heating with thermostat, humidifying and the automatic watering of the plants.The plc and hmi are both connected to an ethernet switch, wich is connected to wifi via a wireless to Lan dongle. The system is in a garage away from the house.SW version 3.01:The control system is based on a Click plc from automation direct and is all programmed in ladder.The CS has thousands of tags, and 150 user-configurable parameters.The parameters can all be accessed and modified via the C-More Micro HMI from automation direct.The parameters all have defined ranges and the user cannot  input a value that is out of range.The control system has an electrical switch to switch from 2 different lighting mode on the fly.The lighting modes timer values are determined by some lighting parameters. (User config via HMI)The control system has a second electrical switch to switch from 2 different \""shaking fan\"" mode on the fly. It allows you to prevent excessive plant shaking on a young plant, and quickly putting it back to normal on a mature plant.The \""shaking fan\"" timer values are determined by some shaking fan parameters. (user config via HMI)I developped with 3.01 a newer way of efficiently venting the greenhouse to prevent uneeded energy losses. The venting has 3 levels (time). The venting level is self adjusted by the control system depending on the \""Calculated Heating Duty Cycle\"" .If it is warm, the \""CHDC\"" will be lower and so the venting can be at a higher level without worrying about loosing heater warm air. If the \""CHDC\"" is higher, the venting will auto-adjust itself to reduced the loss of heated air.Unfortunatly i have reached the character Limit -_-";null
anas-ibrahim;1;01-11-2020;31-12-2020;Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction \u2013 Kaggle Competition 2020;I participated in the MoA Kaggle competition that aims in advancing drug development through improvements to MoA prediction algorithms. In this project I performed feature engineering, first by using variance thresholds to remove any uninformative data from the dataset. I then applied principal component analysis (PCA) on the gene features, and the cell features separately. I also calculated the correlation between gene type and cell type and showed its effect/contribution to correctly predict the target label. After features are calculated, I applied quantile transformation to transform the data to be normally distributed, and then applied z-normalization to scale the data.I used Tensorflow and Keras Functional API to build  two sub models within the master model, the first one is a shallow neural network and the second a deep one, this is done to allow the model to learn as much patterns as possible from the data at hand.The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard using the log loss function.My algorithm achieved a score of 0.01736, and the top score of the top participants in the leaderboard was 0.01599.;null

anas-ibrahim;5;01-04-2016;31-05-2016;Cross-Site Scripting Prevention;I implemented a Web-app to simulate cross-site scripting prevention.The application consisted of server side, client side, and a database. MongoDB was used as a local database, Express JS and NodeJS were used to create the server side and to link the application with the database, AngularJS/JavaScript/HTML were used for the client side. Before adding a post, a user must create a username and password. The username should be unique, and the password is salted and hashed with iterations of 1000 (it can be changed as desired), and the hash of the password is stored in the database. Crypto module was used to perform the password encryption. The implementation also includes sanitization techniques to prevent cross site scripting attacks.;null

The plan is bring this curriculum to an online course to inspire other kids to try and build their ideas and dreams.I also support the education of Coding in schools and taught at a younger level.  My 6 year old daughter was one of the first to learn Coding in HTML before she could read.  Children should be given the opportunity to learn code with their exposure to technology in their lives.  I believe, (but have no proof) that Coding is as important as learning another language.  I also believe that coding is a potential therapy language for children with learning disabilities or behaviours.My goal is to ensure my children are knowledgable about the technology surrounding them and to stay educated on how to create, design, operate and enjoy the developments presented to them.;https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1k30ormdn1l78q/AbisLoveSandalEducation%%20%%281%%29.pdf?dl=0

An online handbook was created to guide new team members through their first 90 days to decrease time to productivity and build comfort while ensuring that new team members feel empowered to drive their own success. A new team member community was also created for social interaction, information sharing, and the ability to ask questions when new team members can't find the answers on their own.We also implemented a virtual environment platform to increase engagement and facilitate networking opportunities.Participant satisfaction rose to 95%% and 90%% of people feel that it is an effective way to learn.;null

camnguyen1;1;01-01-2012;31-05-2012;Lightening the Load: Changing American Dietary Habits and Reducing Healthcare Costs;Rising healthcare costs have put a serious burden on the United States. Chronic diseases that are related to obesity make up a great bulk of healthcare expenditures. We focused on reducing these costs through changing American eating habits.We conducted 30-45 minute interviews with professionals and policymakers in Washington D.C. to help shape our analysis. We suggested 1) taxing sugary beverages to disincentivize their consumption, 2) improving the labelling of packaged foods so that nutritional information is more comprehensible to consumers, and 3) implementing various educational programs to change future generations' behaviours going forward.Besides a written report, we also successfully delivered a 2-hour public presentation to discuss our views and findings.;null

pratikdeshpande;1;01-06-2014;01-07-2014;Research:Power-Throughput Tradeoffs of 802.11n/ac in Smartphones;Conducted a detailed experimental study of 802.11n/ac throughput and power consumption in modern smartphones. We experimented with a variety of smartphones, supporting different subsets of the 802.11n/ac features. We investigated the power consumption in various states of the wireless interface (sleep, idle, active), the impact of various features of 802.11n/ac (PHY bitrate,frame aggregation, channel bonding, MIMO) on both throughput and power consumption, and the tradeoffs between these two metrics. Some of our findings are significantly different from the findings of previous studies using 802.11n/ac wireless cards for laptop/desktop computers. We believe that these findings will help in understanding various performance and power consumption issues in today\u2019s smartphones and will guide the design of power optimization algorithms for the next generation of mobile devices.;http://infocom2015.ieee-infocom.org/program

The show will cater to women, as well as men, within the ages of 16 - 99 as it will focus on:Marriages (estranged, divorce)Siblings (rivalries, separations, feuds, jealousy)Parent-child relationships (conflict, neglect/abandonment, disappointments)Friendships (betrayals, lies)Abusive relationships (physical, emotional, sexual, psychological)Professional relationships (co-worker conflict, promotion disappointments, contentious boss-employee relationships)The participant's willingness to be vulnerable and expose themselves, their truths, hurts and pains will be buffered by a counsellor/therapist who will work collaboratively with the participant and their adversary throughout the program.\""If this program sounds like something that you would be interested in working on with me, please contact me.Peace and blessings to you,Margo Thompson\u00a9 2012 by Margo Thompson";http://www.blogtalkradio.com/forgivemeforgivemenot

The understanding and the daily practice of creating the life we want to live, to discover who we really are, and to give the world our personal gifts of who we are, by fulfilling our mission.Those times that I had to deal with great challenges and/or I just forgot my infinite potential and power, I had great people around me who reminded me of what I possessed.I am practicing this truth in my daily life.Sometimes it is easy, sometimes it is not\u2026 but this is the journey of growth in life.I know that I can do it, because I did it many times.

stav-shaked-27125570;1;01-11-2012;30-11-2012;The Effect of Contact Pressure on Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Release from in vitro Cultured Endothelium;Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheterization is one of the most frequently invasive procedures performed in hospitals throughout the world. Short Peripheral Catheter (SPC) is the typical IV device, usually inserted into small peripheral veins in the upper hand.Phlebitis, the inflammation of the vein wall, is the most common complication of intravenous therapy, affecting 27%%-70%% of all patients receiving it. We believe that the evolution of SPC related phlebitis is strongly dependent on the mechanical interaction between the catheter track and the inner endothelial layer of the veins wall. This interaction may encourage the development of inflammation, i.e phlebitis. In this research we examined the effect of an elevated pressure magnitude on the evolution of inflammation in in-vitro cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) by quantification of the vWF released from Weibel- Palade bodies to the medium as an indication to inflammation process, using the ELISA method. Results showed a strong dependency between the secreted vWF and the pressure magnitude exerted on the cells.Planning low molecular weight catheters to abate the stress acting on the endothelial layer or perhaps catheters that avoid any contact with the inner vessel wall might reduce the symptoms arising in phlebitis and minimize patient's risk of developing phlebitis, and therefore reduce hospital costs.;null

The physical closeness helps them feel that they are still connected to the institution.Holistic accompaniment/guidance of participants \u2013 therapeutic/educational/mental \u2013 we take care of participants' welfare from all aspects.Therapeutic Outdoor Workshops \u2013 MENIFA sees these workshops as an integral part of working with youth at risk.Working with at risk youth from different sectors of Israeli society and especially with religious teens. We bring to the programs our in-depth understanding and knowledge of the unique characteristics of the religious sector.Employing and Training Intern Teachers \u2013 In all our programs we employ intern teachers for various subjects. The advantage of this is multiple: teachers in the outset of their career learn valuable lessons and gain important insights about working with at risk youth and how to reach out to them. On the other hand because they have no prior experience of the education system they are not tainted by existing approaches and attitudes (which more often than not are not beneficial to drop out youth).;http://www.menifa.org.il/?lat=en

yakir-shchigelski-7a44774b;11;01-01-2014;31-12-2014;University Final Project: Visualization of GDL Algorithms (Link to video);This project presents a development of a prototype of a visualization tool which interfaces with a simulator that is running GDL Algorithms as part of academic research conducted by Dr. Roie Zivan on behalf Ben-Gurion University. The main goal of the project is to provide a visualization tool that will aid with better understanding and simplification of the algorithm operation, therefore improving the quality of the research time spent.The research deals with Max / Min-sum algorithm which is used to solve the DCOP problem. As part of the study, a method was proposed which outreach the solution, obtained from the algorithm run, to the optimal solution. This method is actually a new version of the algorithm Max / Min-sum named \u201cMax-sum_AD\u201d.Until this project completion, there was an extensive use in the study of a manual drafting for visualizing Max-sum_AD algorithm run. It was brought to mind that developing an automatic visualization tool will save valuable research time and allow examining problems with large numbers of variables, for which the manual drafting is not a practical use.As part of the characterization and design process, design criteria\u2019s were set, market survey was conducted for examining the available frameworks for development of visualization tools and an analysis of the simulator was carried out in which the operations sequence and processes that are executed during the algorithm run were examined.After examining several alternatives, it was decided to create the visualization tool in a way that the simulator runs on an proxy server and communicates with an HTML file which process and manipulates the data using JavaScript which finally displays an output graph. The tool is designed to be accessible and easy to use for the research team. The development was implemented in Object Oriented design, using the languages Json, Java, JavaScript, and HTML. At the same time using - CSS, JQuery, Ajax, Java Servlets and Spring Toolsuite.;http://youtu.be/bCq8e--dfiw

sharif-ghithan-33422773;2;01-10-2010;31-10-2010;ICNAS Project;The group at LIP develops this project in collaboration with ICNAS, the structure belonging to the University of Coimbra that hosts a proton cyclotron for applications in nuclear medicine. The collaboration has already moved forward in its goals in several aspects related with (1) instrumentation for proton beam measurements, and (2) automatic irradiation and quantification of doses of several Gy down to one hundred mGy. The final goal of the project is to provide the end user with a setup offering the possibility of carrying out proton dosimetric experiments together with small-animal radiotherapy studies. One of the goals of the project is to allow studies in the field of radiotherapy comprising total doses between a few cGy to a few Gy, as well as studies in the field of radiation protection, hence comprising doses of the order of a few hundreds down to tens of mGy.In 2014 several developments were accomplished within the aforementioned objectives. We are now able to control a homogeneous beam spot on target with a diameter of 16 mm, and excluding the (computed) outer skirts of the beam where non-homogeneity occurs. This was intended in order to allow the controlled irradiation of cell cultures located in typical biological multi-well dishes with diameters of 16 mm. The control of the magnetic field applied inside the cyclotron plays a major role for achieving said homogeneity. A scan revealing a quasi-gaussian shape must be performed before any irradiation, with the final shutter closed, so that the optimum magnetic field can be applied hence producing a homogeneous target dose. Inhomogeneity quantification is ongoing, with first results pointing to values inferior to +/- 3%%. A setup for cell-culture irradiation has also been constructed. Plans are to perform first dose-survival curves soon.;http://coimbra.lip.pt/index.php?id=3&prid=61&lg=en

Much of the mammalian genome recently was shown to be transcribed to long noncoding RNAs, one class of which is the enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) whose levels largely correlate with the mRNA levels of the target gene but whose functions are not yet clear. We examined the eRNA produced from a functional enhancer that directs cell-specific expression of the gonadotropin hormone \u03b1-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha, in the pituitary. We show that this eRNA plays a crucial role in facilitating DNA looping between the enhancer and promoter and directs histone modifications that are essential for transcription initiation and without which the chromatin becomes repressive to transcription. In this way, the eRNA mediates the function of the enhancer in directing basal gene expression;http://www.pnas.org/content/112/14/4369.full.pdf

Our strategic exposure and relationship to highly potential suppliers along with our vast experience in global solutions led us to successfully establish a fruitful partnership and import the first tower crane that successfully met the European standards demanded by the Economic and Industrial governmental body.We were the first company to fully meet the standards demanded by SII (Standard Israel Institute), and the only company to meet the quality, auditing, inspection, and relevant tests within 1 week visit of SII engineers to China. The tower crane was assembled and tested in China, and we mediated in maintaining full support from Chinese engineers throughout the assembling and certification.Strategic logistic decisions were made for shipment of 50 containers, taking into account the loading, security, insurance, price, and leading time to meet the needs of our customer.Until this day, this project is still a model used for the consequent tower crane importers.;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLcOWbWVxg

However, energy needs to be converted into power in order to make use of it. Waste heat recovery is an economic method to increase the overall efficiency of the plant and, thus, to lower fuel demand. Exhaust gas of various processes is carrying a huge amount of energy also referred to as waste heat. Often industrial processes produce enough waste heat to generate electricity. Waste Heat Recovery Units or heat to power units could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity by using an Organic Rankine Cycle. During this project it was designed an Electrical Power Unit of 12.47KV/7.5MW generated by Waste Heat Recovery Unit with Organic Rankine Cycle technology. A generator, auxiliary transformer, switches, starters, circuit breakers, cables, protection and measurement systems were selected, calculated and designed.;null

The simulation focuses on the propagation of visible and near-infrared light in biological tissues. This research has mainly two findings: (1) the transition can be described, as was found experimentally, with good accuracy by only two terms (ballistic and diffusive). (2) The model can be utilized for cases where the absorption coefficient is not negligible compared to the scattering coefficient by adding a power-law prefactor to the diffusive term.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.21.6.066004

During the project we studied the bone's physical characteristics, disease characteristics and the impact on the bone from early to late phases of the disease.We developed using MATLAB two modules for the following tasks: image segmentation, statistical measurements and image transformation.The developed system was tested using 3 groups of patients (30 images). The system tests show that segmentation of digital radiographs was performed successfully in 95%% of investigated cases. Measurements of digital radiographs after image transformation show significant improvements for diagnostics purposes.";null

We give you an easier and faster way to get and provide lifts which answer your needs and preferences.You can search lifts by starting point, destination, time range, distance, price and preferences, and sort them by date or distance. Only Technion students can join the app and you can choose default places in your route, or even your current GPS location. In addition, there is a calendar view where you can see all your scheduled rides, and you get notifications that show you requests, confirmations or rejections of rides. You can chat with other users and plan desired lifts for the future, and get notified when a new drive that meet your requirements is set.By those features, we change the process of setting a lift and make it an easy and intuitive task, that is completed by few clicks and saves time and energy for the user.;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technion.android.tech_pool

amitweizner;1;01-01-2012;31-12-2012;Sub-pixel visible light eye gaze estimation system;Eye gaze estimation is one of the most exciting technologies, allowing users to control computers interfaces solely with their eyes, investigating and diagnosing cognitive problems regarding reading, analyzing the focus of attention of websites users for more efficient advertising, and so on. The reason such technologies are not common in every house for everyday applications, is mainly because of the high cost of the equipment and hardware needed to accomplish such complicated tasks, and the intrusiveness of many of such systems, that limit the usage of these technologies to laboratory tasks only.The goal of this research was to design and develop an algorithm for a low-cost, non-intrusive, fully automatic real time system for eye gaze estimation. I used simple and inexpensive visible light webcam to capture video frames of the user. Then, with a simple and short calibration process, I was able to estimate the user gaze in an accuracy of less than 1 mean angular error for both horizontal and vertical directions at a frame rate of 60 frames per second.The implementation of this research was developed using OpenCV and Matlab.For this research I was honored with the Uri Peled memorial prize award for Excellence research.;null

dakra;1;01-01-2013;31-12-2013;7-Eleven Server Capacity Threshold Forecasting;7-Eleven wanted to be able to do their own analysis of performance data we collected for all their servers. I designed and implemented a database schema that allowed aggregates of different kinds and levels to coexist in one normalized table. I defined queries that extracted items-of-interest into a needs-attention table. Items of interest included servers that could be expected to breach any of several thresholds in the near future based on either linear or compound growth rates.;null
dakra;2;01-01-2012;31-12-2012;Morrisons Supermarket Outsourcing;Morrisons had several IT problems: obsolete mainframes, staff over time, and no tested Disaster Recovery. They sought to solve these via outsourcing. While most potential providers were proposing new machines on provider premises, we were not in a position to do the same. I envisioned a much lower cost, lower risk, and quicker-to-completion solution. It safely deferred equipment replacement, eliminated relocation and networking issues, supplemented their staff, and let our team implement DR and run scheduled tests.The Morrisons project team and consultant called this solution innovative. The higher executives considered it, but ultimately chose off-site outsourcing.;null
dakra;3;01-11-2010;30-04-2011;CSG International - Mainframe High Availability and Disaster Recovery Strategy;CSG's clients were demanding faster recoverability from a mainframe or data center outage. Some wanted an outage to impact not more than half their customers. I explained the HA and DR choices to CSG technical management, gathered their evaluation criteria, then organized the very many combinations into three clusters and best-in-class within each cluster. This let us all focus on three best choices, each with its own value, cost and effort. It set their roadmap. It let their IT executives and client teams present the choices and costs to their major customers.;null
dakra;4;01-01-2011;31-12-2011;Calpine Business Application Technical Evaluation;Based on business function, Calpine narrowed consideration of vendors for a core business application down to a few.I created a an information gathering document so we could understand how the package functioned, could be deployed & operated in Calpine's environment, and meet non-functional requirements. It addressed Application Architecture, Technical Architecture, Data Architecture, Network Architecture, Operations, and fit for Cloud Computing. It allowed the thorough gathering of all the information in a single few-hour-long working session.;null
dakra;5;01-01-2011;31-12-2011;Calpine Storage Growth Containment;Calpine's storage usage was growing wildly. The lines of business had no charge-back and no way of seeing what their usage was nor its growth trend. They also did not forecast and report anticipated needs. I developed and implemented a business and a technical process to address these issues. I developed the tooling to link storage assignments to server to application to owner. Extrapolating from past usage, the tooling anticipated when thresholds would be crossed based on linear and compound growth projections. Monthly meetings with each line of business presented their results, compared them to other units, and collected other anticipated new requirements.;null
dakra;6;;null;A&P Store Inventory Scanner Uploads;If only the handheld inventory scanners in every A&P store could communicate with the store's server, A&P could reassign a large data center team from boring nightly outbound-dial communications tasks. They could also eliminate data center and store modems, PBX ports, data center dial equipment, and long distance charges. I solved device configuration, cable, character set and protocol problems, letting the dream come true after many years.;null
dakra;7;;null;AT&T Customer Data Warehouse;AT&T wanted to consolidate all customer data into a large, customer-oriented transactional data warehouse that would scale beyond current technology in terms of size, services, transaction rate, and complexity of data structure. I analyzed their RFP for IBM Global Services, led the IBM team at the RFP Q&A session, and then led the architecture and message engineering sub teams on the RFP response. I consulted with IBM\u2019s lead SQL architects so as to align the proposed solution with IBM\u2019s future direction. I suggested a switch from a remote procedure call mindset to one based on SQL syntax, stored procedures, multiple result sets, object-based message structures, and MMR data compression.The message structure I defined built on one I had developed for a retail brokerage.  IBM Global Services also used it in other projects.;null
dakra;8;;null;Arrow Electronics System Internationalization;I helped the executive team of an electronic parts distributor refine their international distribution strategy, including critical success factors and strategies leading to competitive advantages. I analyzed their existing US domestic sales and supply systems, considering the possibility of using them as the basis for converged systems for their foreign subsidiaries and export / import business. My recommendations helped avoid investing over $14,000,000 to internationalize and extend the old US system.;null
dakra;9;;null;CGU Insurance - Workflow Security;Worked with the MQWorkflow team in Germany, the WebSphere BI team in Florida, the WS Portal teams in NC and CA, the customer and the application developer company to arrive at ways to use a single IBM Directory and to accomplish single sign on and single password change.;null
dakra;10;;null;Chubb Insurance - Browser access to Lotus Notes/Domino Applications;I led Chubb's pilot effort to web enable a Lotus Notes application. I coordinated efforts with the Chubb team and IBM's Software Migration Project Office. With Chubb, I examined their application and documented which Notes client facilities they had used from among those that were not yet provided to a browser client. For all these I developed JavaScript and LotusScript techniques to circumvent the Domino/Browser limitations. As a result, Chubb proceeded with deploying Domino applications throughout the company.With Chubb concurrence, I presented the project method, coding techniques, results, and tips to developers at IBM's Profession Leadership Technical Exchange and provided the same materials for inclusion in the internal Lotus Notes Best Practices Conference database.;null
dakra;11;;null;Citibank Latin America B2B Payments Security;I negotiated and architected with the head of CitiBank Data Security and Data Center management to add virtualized zSeries to the set of allowed servers in their DMZ with WebSphere Application Server. This was based on the mainframe's Common Criteria EAL certification. The solution was used for both unsecured transactions and for secured transactions exploiting a custom web server plug-in.;null
dakra;12;;null;Citibank Processing Private Credit Card Applications at In-Store Checkout;"I eliminated the need for load balancing components, their needs for redundancy and failover, and extra network message flows by exploiting duplexed shared coupling facilities for mainframe-based WebSphere MQ server and applications. The \""pull\"" oriented approach plus the ability to launch additional server instances when queues reached a chosen depth, further combined to eliminate other software components. The client's anticipated need to create monitoring, scheduling, launch and termination techniques went away. The custom solution elements could now be only those providing business function. IBM and ISV products could handle monitoring.";null
dakra;13;;null;Continental Insurance Distributed Print;I extended, in one month, Continental's existing CICS based 3270 print system. I changed it to download compressed, unformatted print data to branch office minicomputers for outboard formatting and printing. I implemented the minicomputer programming, including coordinated, online mainframe database updates for check printing. My design reduced print traffic on the network. and eliminated host workload due to reprinting for 100 sites.;null
dakra;14;;null;Continental Insurance PC-Minicomputer Integration;I designed, prototyped, demonstrated, and piloted an early example of using PC's as very intelligent workstations for minicomputer applications. The effort included porting part of the application from the mini to the PC. I architected the solution so that existing applications could run unaware that their data repository services were being provided by another machine. I designed and implemented the production PC and minicomputer messaging and use of the communications API, including an assembler language TSR on the PC side.;null
dakra;15;;null;Crum & Foster: Management Span of Control Negotiation;"Executives within Crum & Foster's IT organization of a large insurer argued over control of \""client / server.\"" At their request, I designed a framework for allocating authority and responsibility for  components and applications among operations, technology, support, and development departments. This framework provided management with a basis for principled negotiation with each other in the best interest of their end users. It allowed for shifts in control as technology matured within the enterprise.This defused the personal aspects of the discussion.";null
dakra;16;;null;Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield: Intolerable Performance;Due to inexplicably poor  performance, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield and their Sigma Imaging software team could not deploy their system.

dakra;17;;null;Equitable (AXA) Distributed Print Disruption;"Equitable AXA's very high volume distributed print shop for the metro NY/NJ area suffered frequent communications disruptions that required operator intervention. This was despite having no problems with voice communications between the sites that shared the high speed link via multiplexer. Visiting the site, I saw that when the communications link dropped for even a fraction of a second, the multiplexer didn't merely indicate that the signal had dropped. Improperly, until the link came back up, it also indicated that the multiplexer itself was not functional.I solved the problem with: (1) A paper clip between two pins on the patch panel; (2) A sign nearby not to remove it until the multiplexer was repaired; and (3) A report to the customer.";null
dakra;18;;null;Equitable (AXA) Single Screen All-Lines of Business Call Center;Equitable wanted all call center staff to be able to answer policy holder questions about all their policies, including information derivable from, but not included in any one of many the stove-pipe back end applications. Rather than desktop screen scraping integration, I architected a CICS/MVS enterprise integration gateway that could communicate to multiple back end CICS and IMS regions. This solution isolated the desktop clients from the back ends, improved response time and reduced network traffic. When screen scraping became a requirement, I figured out how to do that inside the mainframe, as stipulated by Equitable.To simplify call center advanced desktop (OS/2) to mainframe communications, I designed and implemented an easy to use programming library for APPC LU6.2 communications.  For simpler, smaller DOS desktops, I designed and implemented a Named Pipe Server on OS/2 that could catch a query inside a simple call from the DOS machines, pass the request up to the mainframe via APPC, then relay the answer back to the client.;null
dakra;19;;null;ILGWU Lost Transactions;"The mainframe side of the ILGWU's two tier system for accepting dues occasionally \""lost\"" an online payment posting. It was caught by nightly batch reconciliation. This had gone on for years. I determined what was happening, where the transactions were going, and how the branch programming was ignoring the error indications coming from the mainframe.";null
dakra;20;;null;Interbank Transaction Difficulties;Two major New York banks went to great efforts to be able to send CICS transactions to each other over SNA protocols, but it only partly worked. They complained formally to IBM management that only one side could initiate communications and then only the other side could send transactions and get responses.Based on the details in the complaint letter, I showed the banks a hypothetical combination of configuration settings and programming usage and verified that it matched what they each had. I then walked them through how these would cause their strange symptoms and the easy changes to achieve their goals. By the next morning it was all working as desired.;null
dakra;21;;null;Merrill Lynch - Technical Negotiations;The workstation to DB2 data access path became a contentious issue during the effort to converge the server-side architecture for a brokerage's financial consultant (broker) workstation with their architecture for customer account access via the Internet. I identified the sixteen different potential paths between a workstation and DB2 data that were possible with the candidate technologies. After gathering information and building diagrams, I turned the endless posturing, emotional argumentation, and push-back among the architecture, applications and database organizations into rational, value based, technical negotiations. The result was mutual understanding and a decision, thereby removing the roadblock and allowing the project to proceed.;null
dakra;22;;null;Merrill Lynch Converged Broker & Consumer Infrastructure;I guided Merrill Lynch in converging the server-side architecture for their financial consultant (broker) workstation with their architecture for customer account access via the Internet. I rationalized the negotiations among the architecture, applications and database organizations. I designed an object-based cross-platform intersystem message content architecture for their custom middleware. The new message format provided for decoupled software changes between communications partners, analysis and parsing by generic routines, and flexibility in code page and binary endian characteristics.I later reused this work in an a project with AT&T and passed it on to others for use in several projects by IGS in Canada.;null
dakra;23;;null;MetLife Financial Management Reporting Reengineering;In preparation for demutualization, MetLife reengineered its financial reporting processes, I served as a consulting architect to the client on overall IT architecture and package selection. I extracted and documented the architectural implications of the business requirements. I based this analysis on initial work by Ernst & Young and completed the research. I conducted documentation reviews, interviews, hands-on usage, and benchmark-level package testing. I recommended appropriate additions to the architecture. I evaluated query software and the Dun & Bradstreet SmartSuite financial reporting system with respect to the architecture. I then convincingly showed how SmartSuite, the business sponsor's preferred package, could provide the model for the division's next generation IT architecture. MetLife successfully deployed SmartSuite on RS/6000 AIX servers and successfully demutualized.;null
dakra;24;;null;Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover Brokerage Convergence;Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover Brokerage was consolidating its user interface, branding, brokerage function, and supporting technology bases for the two retail divisions' Internet offerings. Each was built on different hardware, application, and database technologies. Each used different back end providers for portfolio administration and order execution services. I showed the team how to map the priorities to a sequence of technology transitions that could achieve both the firm's externally visible business objectives and the internally valued IT objectives. As long as both platforms coexisted, the design allowed for growing accounts to migrate up to the Dean Witter high-value platform and for shrinking accounts to migrate down to Discover's platform.;null
dakra;25;;null;NYNEX and Bell Atlantic Desktop, Mainframe, VAX Integration;I designed and supervised development of n-tier multiplatform client / server system architectures at NYNEX and Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems. I quickly defined solutions to challenges that had been outstanding for 6 months prior to my involvement. I ensured that components were portable among CICS/ESA, CICS/OS/2, IMS/ESA, COBOL II, MicroFocus COBOL, and OS/2. I also provided application interoperability between IBM SNA CICS Token-ring and DEC TCP/IP VMS Ethernet environments in a way that minimized additional components on workstations and the mainframes. I designed the network to carry SNA, BANYAN, and NETBIOS traffic.These architectures isolated applications programmers from communications programming and permitted application designers to select the best platform for each component.;null
dakra;26;;null;Resolving Problems that Evaded Solutions;In some of the projects described above, I satisfied outstanding needs that had evaded fulfillment by others. The following five case studies represent situations where I resolved long outstanding problems that others could not fix.;null
dakra;27;;null;Richmond Federal Reserve Bank Extranet Capacity;I reviewed the extranet support architecture for the Richmond Fed, comparing installed and anticipated resources with a workload model I created from business user inputs. This effort demonstrated the needs to exploit multisite Internet attachment capacity, to acquire additional resources for concentrated peak periods, and to prioritize quality of service for interactive traffic vs. file transfers.;null
dakra;28;;null;Royal Insurance: Access by Independent Agents;So that the minicomputers that independent insurance agents used could dial in to Royal Insurance, I created an autonomic 3270 protocol converter. It concurrently supported both SNA/SDLC and Bisynch 3270 on upstream links and 3275 Bisynch dial on the downstream links. Using CF and EDX on a Series/1, I adapted the dial 3780 driver to handle the unique error handling sequences of 3275 Bisynch dial. I created a message driven autonomic operator to monitor the system. It recovered from disconnects, timeouts, restarts or other situations. It operated for years without human intervention other than changing paper and ribbons on the log printer.;null
dakra;29;;null;SIAC Online Fraud Investigation;I architected a fault surviving solution for transcribing IP multicast trade information into relational DBMS\u2019s, as the trades happen, while providing concurrent online SQL query access to that information. The solution allowed for concurrent processing at two active sites, with rapid resynchronization after recovery from site outages and inter-site communications failures.;null
dakra;30;;null;Salomon Smith Barney B2B and B2C Stock Options;For the next generation stock options system that among others handles IBM's stock options, I successfully led the proposal effort over a nearly year long multiphase RFP process, winning vs. Sun + Oracle + Bea. This included WebSphereAS, WebSphere MQ, and DB2 on IBM systems.;null
dakra;31;;null;Salomon Smith Barney Web Brokerage;Salomon Smith Barney was dissatisfied with the capacity, reliability and availability of their web brokerage system, hosted by IBM. I led the customer, IBM Global Web Hosting, DB2, RS/6000, Communications Products, and IBM Storage Systems groups to achieve greater capacity, reliability and availability for the customer-facing applications. I was the lead architect creating a next-generation system design, along with a viable path to this converged future system from the four application architectures they had. I showed the how to exploit Network Dispatcher for load balancing, concurrent maintenance, failover, and improved SSL performance. I developed a new higher performance - higher availability pattern for creating loops of mirrored SSA disks and paired adapters for HACMP triple node sets. The solutions were negotiated in working sessions with IBM and customer technical and executive staff.;null
dakra;32;;null;Salomon Smith Barney, Towers Perrin, TD Waterhouse, AIG, CGU, Giant Bear, Scholastic, Muze, Federated Department Stores, Wall Street Journal, Skoodles, Pep Boys, etc: e-business Architecture;I architected the application model, WebSphere Application Server, other middleware, and integration. I conducted architecture & design workshops and then design reviews. I allocated the function and data into nodes in zones at sites for performance, scalability, availability, security, concurrent maintenance, manageability, and efficiency. I worked with the complex opportunity manager, HW & SW teams and business partners to do the total solution configuration and pricing. I created a multi-site, multi-environment, multiphase pricing spreadsheet that makes it easy to price different scenarios and phases. It adjusts software licenses to match the numbers and sizes of the solution elements.;null
dakra;33;;null;Sapient WebSphere Best Practices & Application Tuning;Sapient asked us for the  best practices for solutions built on WebSphere Application Server. These were splattered over many Redbooks and web pages. I gathered, summarized, cross referenced and organized almost 300 of them. The result provided access by architecture domain+subdomain,    project phase, and technology tier. The audience could then map these to the people who would authorize and execute the practices, when they would do so, and to what.This client's particular application had a response time problem at the first step of the most common use case.  I determined that the design was unnecessarily both human user and system resource abusive.  A simple change would reduce not only mind & eye strain for the user and the total task time, but also the system load and interaction response time.;null
dakra;34;;null;TIAA/CREF, AT&T, Merrill Lynch etc.: n-tier Latency Determination and Problem Isolation for SOA Frameworks;I included performance instrumentation in the multitier SOA frameworks I architected and developed for several clients. It let client-end code determine the latency caused by every instrumented tier, layer, and function, from the desktop up through n-tiers of server, including CICS & IMS. If something failed, it let the upstream failure point be identified from the client.  The instrumentation only cost one subtraction and and an if-zero at every call into or out of the framework, plus 2 bytes in the message header.  It had C/C++ and COBOL interoperating versions.It let the client remotely peel the bags of onions without causing any tears.;null
dakra;35;;null;Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA/CREF) Business Application Remote Procedure Call;In under two work-weeks, I designed, developed, tested, documented, and delivered a robust generic AS/400 APPC RPC server facility with sample applications and business programmer training. I isolated communications programming from business applications and vice versa. This saved months of programmer education and future maintenance. The clients were desktops and the mainframe.This facility was portable to CICS and thus could be used throughout the organization. A year later, I did the same for a generic AS/400 APPC client, so business applications could send requests to other AS/400's or the mainframe.;null

dakra;37;;null;UPS Workload Modeling;"I developed a multi-tier system workload modeling tool to allow \""what if\"" impact analysis of function and data placement decisions very early in the design process. The tool linked business volume drivers to use cases, then use cases to component interaction models and the multiple nodes where the components were to be. For each node type, the tool determined the workload, the network traffic in & out, data access rate, and print load. It also aggregated the non-functional requirements placed on each node based on the needs of the use cases.I used it in the Functional Specifications phase of an End-to-End Design engagement for UPS international customs handling. It clearly showed the better of two alternatives for relaying interactive traffic. This allowed the midrange systems to be half as powerful as would otherwise have been needed. The model showed the enormous network impact of separating functions from the data they use.";null

Over time, the user can get a precise and personal picture of his or hers happiness and also compare with that of other users, based on intelligent classifications. In addition, it is possible to upload a photo of a happy moment to the website. This helps create a mosaic of locations based happy moments.I was in charge of managing the project, which includes planning, characterizing, UX and UI design and marketing, as well as managing 8 people.;http://www.mooderator.co.il

ohadlandau;1;01-03-2013;30-11-2013;Implementation of an Adaptive Viterbi Decoder chip;The use of error-correcting codes has proven to be an effective way to overcome data corruption in digital data transmission. Decoding algorithms, such as Viterbi algorithm, are often used in channel receivers to recover data that has been corrupted by channel noise. Although implementations of the Viterbi algorithm have shown good noise tolerance, these implementations require an exponential increase in area and power consumption to achieve increased decoding accuracy. In order to reduce this algorithm's complexity, the Adaptive Viterbi Algorithm (AVA) has been developed. The aim of the project described in this document is to design and implement an AVA decoder chip.;null

However, such systems are expensive and require professional installation. On the other side, a significant increase has made in smartphone use. In order to spread this important accessory to the mainstream market, efforts are made to develop LDWS as a smartphone application. The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm for such an application, while testing different options for implementation. The chosen algorithm combines image processing methods from several articles, with a Kalman-filter based tracking system. The parameters were chosen empirically. Experimental results show that the algorithm performs reliably and robustly under different road and lighting conditions.
