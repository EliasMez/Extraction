By using an optical experimental setup to probe the electro-optic response of twist cells under an AC electric field, we measure the characteristic switch times and Freedericksz threshold of doped nematic liquid crystals. The effects associated with the surface plasmon resonance and disorder induced by the metallic guest particles are analyzed. Further, we exploit the Gooch-Tarry conditions and Mauguin minima to account the thermal dependence of nematic birefringence in pristine and doped samples.

%C3%A1bner-magalh%C3%A3es-nunes-4a8870197;2;;Toxicology;01-02-2019;Gold nanorods (AuNRs) have been studied extensively in biomedicine due to their biocompatibility and their unique properties. Some studies reported that AuNRs selectively accumulate on cancer cell mitochondria causing its death. However, the immediate effects of this accumulation needed further investigations. In this context, we evaluated the effect of AuNRs on the mitochondrial integrity of isolated rat liver mitochondria. We verified that AuNRs decreased the mitochondrial respiratory ratio by decreasing the phosphorylation and maximal states. Additionally, AuNRs caused a decrease in the production of mitochondrial ROS and a delay in mitochondrial swelling. Moreover, even with cyclosporine A treatment, AuNRs disrupted the mitochondrial potential. With the highest concentration of AuNRs studied, disorganized mitochondrial crests and intermembrane separation were observed in TEM images. These results indicate that AuNRs can interact with mitochondria, disrupting the electron transport chain.

By using Z-scan technique in the configuration of fully open aperture and normal incidence, we analyze the changes in the absorption coefficient of a homeotropic sample upon laser exposure. Our results reveal that the electric field may suppress the nonlinear absorption of the samples well bellow to smectic-A-nematic transition temperature. The effects of the external electric field on the interplay between smectic order and plasmon resonance are analyzed.;https://doi.org/10.1080/15421406.2017.1402631
%C3%A1bner-magalh%C3%A3es-nunes-4a8870197;4;;Physical Review E;01-12-2017;The present study is devoted to the investigation of the nonlinear optical properties of a smectic liquid crystal doped with gold nanorods. Using the Z-scan technique, we investigate the changes in the optical birefringence of a homeotropic sample upon laser exposure, considering the configurations of normal and oblique incidence. Our results reveal that the birefringence variations may be governed by distinct physical mechanisms, depending on the relative angle between the far-field director and the wave vector of the excitation laser beam. In particular, we observe that the position dependence of the far-field transmittance exhibits different behaviors as the incidence angle is changed, indicating that distortions in the beam wavefront may be associated with the thermal lens phenomenon or an optically induced reorientation of the nematic director. The temperature dependence of the nonlinear refractive and absorptive coefficients is investigated close to the smectic-nematic phase transition. A detailed analysis of the interplay between smectic order and plasmon resonance is performed, thus unveiling the capability of plasmonic liquid crystal to be used in optical devices.;https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.062703
%C3%A1bner-magalh%C3%A3es-nunes-4a8870197;5;;Carbohydrate Polymers;01-11-2016;Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are suitable for constructing self-assembled structures for the development of biosensing devices and are usually obtained in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Here, a sulfated chitosan (ChiS) and gum arabic (GA) were employed to encapsulate CTAB/AuNRs with the purpose of studying the interactions of the polysaccharides with CTAB, which is cytotoxic and is responsible for the instability of nanoparticles in buffer solutions. The presence of a variety of functional groups such as the sulfate groups in ChiS and the carboxylic groups in GA, led to efficient interactions with CTAB/AuNRs as evidenced through UV\u2013vis and FTIR spectroscopies. Electron microscopies (HR-SEM and TEM) revealed that nanoparticle clusters were formed in the GA-AuNRs sample, whereas individual AuNRs, surrounded by a dense layer of polysaccharides, were observed in the ChiS-AuNRs sample. Therefore, the presented work contributes to the understanding of the driving forces that control the surface interactions of the studied materials, providing useful information in the building-up of gold self-assembled nanostructures.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.018
%C3%A1bner-magalh%C3%A3es-nunes-4a8870197;6;2013;Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry;01-02-2016;We synthesized two organometallic diazepam\u2013palladium(II) derivatives by C\u2013H activation of diazepam (DZP) with palladium salts, i.e., PdCl2 and Pd(OAc)2 (OAc = acetate). Both compounds obtained are air stable and were isolated in good yields. The anticonvulsant potential of the complexes, labeled [(DZP)PdCl]2 and [(DZP)PdOAc]2, was evaluated through two animal models: pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)- and picrotoxin (PTX)-induced convulsions. The organometallic DZP\u2013palladium(II) acetate complex, [(DZP)PdOAc]2, significantly increased (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) latencies and protected the animals against convulsions induced by PTZ and PTX, while the analogous chloro derivative, [(DZP)PdCl]2, was effective (p < 0.01) only in the PTZ model. These effects appear to be mediated through the GABAergic system. The possible mechanism of action of the DZP\u2013palladium(II) complexes was also confirmed with the use of flumazenil (FLU), a GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex site antagonist. Herein, we present the first report of the anticonvulsant properties of organometallic DZP\u2013palladium(II) complexes as well as evidence that these compounds may play an important role in the study of new drugs to treat patients with epilepsy.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2015.11.024

By using the time-resolved Z-scan technique, we determine the effects of nanoparticle addition on the critical behavior of the thermal diffusivity and thermo-optical coefficient at the vicinity of the smectic-nematic phase transition. Our results reveal that introduction of gold nanoparticles affects the temperature dependence of thermo-optical parameters, due to the local distortions in the orientational order and heat generation provided by guest particles during the laser exposure. Further, we show that a nonlinear optical response may take place at temperatures where the smectic order is well established. We provide a detailed discussion of the effects associated with the introduction gold nanoparticles on the mechanisms behind the thermal transport and optical nonlinearity in liquid-crystal samples.;https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.04250

The kinetics of formation, the aspect ratio, and the selectivity of the particles were evaluated according to the parameters of synthesis: the growth-driving agent, seed, and gold precursor concentrations. In 2\u20134 h, the rod particles attained the expected size and shape under kinetic control, and were stable for at least 2 days. In order to obtain good quality AuNRs in good yields, without enrichment, we suggest keeping the growth-driving agent/gold molar ratio, the AuI/seed ratio, and the concentration of the reagents in the final solution within specific ranges. For example, even if good molar ratios between the reagents are maintained, relatively highly concentrated reaction solutions lead to AuNRs with lower aspect ratios. The main properties of the prepared colloidal systems and the nanoparticles were evaluated by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crci.2013.01.013

%7Epxhan;1;;IEEE ICASSP 2016;01-03-2016;acceptance rate: 47%.Abstract: In this paper, a communication-efficient multi-processor compressed sensing framework based on the approximate message passing algorithm is proposed. We perform lossy compressionon the data being communicated between processors, resulting in a reduction in communication costs with a minor degradation in recovery quality. In the proposed framework, a new state evolution formulation takes the quantization error into account, and analytically determines the coding raterequired in each iteration. Two approaches for allocating the coding rate, an online back-tracking heuristic and an optimal allocation scheme based on dynamic programming, provide significant reductions in communication costs.;null
%7Epxhan;2;;Proc. SPIE Defense + Security: Sensors and Systems for Space Applications IX;01-01-2016;System state estimation in the presence of an adversary that injects false information into sensor readings has attracted much attention in wide application areas, such as target tracking with compromised sensors, secure monitoring of dynamic electric power systems, secure driverless cars, and radar tracking and detection in the presence of jammers. From a malicious adversary\u2019s perspective, the optimal strategy for attacking a multi-sensor dynamic system over sensors and over time is investigated. It is assumed that the system defender can perfectly detect the attacks and identify and remove sensor data once they are corrupted by false information injected by the adversary. With this in mind, the adversary\u2019s goal is to maximize the covariance matrix of the system state estimate by the end of attack period under a sparse attack constraint such that the adversary can only attack the system a few times over time and over sensors. The sparsity assumption is due to the adversary\u2019s limited resources and his/her intention to reduce the chance of being detected by the system defender. This becomes an integer programming problem and its optimal solution, the exhaustive search, is intractable with a prohibitive complexity, especially for a system with a large number of sensors and over a large number of time steps. Several suboptimal solutions, such as those based on greedy search and dynamic programming are proposed to find the attack strategies. Examples and numerical results are provided in order to illustrate the effectiveness and the reduced computational complexities of the proposed attack strategies.;null
%7Epxhan;3;;Proc. Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS);01-01-2016;Approximate massage passing (AMP) is an iterative algorithm for sparse signal recovery, where each iteration consists of three steps computing pseudo data, denoising and updating the residual. In this paper, under a recently proposed distributed AMP (DiAMP) framework, we propose a new estimator of the mean squared error of pseudo data in AMP. Moreover, a new distributed data querying algorithmis developed, in order to save communication cost in the global computation (GC) of DiAMP. Compared with GC of AMP (GCAMP) proposed in our earlier work, the new algorithm enables one-bit sign transmission, and is therefore named as sign-aware GC (SAGC). Numerical results show that SAGC improves signicantly upon GCAMP in terms of communication savings.;null

The proposed distributed IHT achieves exactly the same recovery result as that by the centralized IHT.;null
%7Epxhan;5;;IEEE ICASSP 2015;01-04-2015;acceptance rate: 52%, number of citations: 3.Abstract: In this paper, we suggest a modified distributed compressed sensing (CS) approach based on the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm, namely, distributed IHT (DIHT). Our technique improves upon a recently proposed DIHT algorithm in two ways. First, for sensing matrices with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, we suggest an efficient and tight method for computing the step size in IHT based on random matrix theory. Second, we improve upon the global computation (GC) step of DIHT by adapting this step to allow for complex data, and reducing the communication cost. The new GC operation involves solving a Top-K problem and is therefore referred to as GC.K. The GC.K-based DIHT has exactly the same recovery results as the centralized IHT given the same step size. Numerical results show that our approach significantly outperforms the modified thresholding algorithm (MTA), another GC algorithm for DIHT proposed in previous work. Our simulations also verify that the proposed method of computing the step size renders the performance of DIHT close to the oracle-aided approach with a given \u201coptimal\u201d step size.;null
%7Epxhan;6;;IEEE GlobalSIP 2014;01-12-2014;number of citations: 4.Abstract: In this paper, an efficient distributed approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, named distributed AMP (DAMP), is developed for compressed sensing (CS) signal recovery in sensor networks with the sparsity K unknown. In the proposed DAMP, distributed sensors do not have to use or know the entire global sensing matrix, and the burden of computation and storage for each sensor is reduced. To reduce communications among the sensors, a new data query algorithm, called global computation for AMP (GCAMP), is proposed. The proposed GCAMP based DAMP approach has exactly the same recovery solution as the centralized AMP algorithm. The performance of the DAMP approach is evaluated in terms of the communication cost saved by using the GCAMP. For the purpose of comparison, thresholding algorithm (TA), a well known distributed Top-K algorithm, is modified so that it also leads to the same recovery solution as the centralized AMP. Numerical results demonstrate that the GCAMP based DAMP outperforms the Modified TA based DAMP, and reduces the communication cost significantly.;null

Although previous studies suggested that \u03b3\u03b42 T cells help control erythrocytic malaria, whether \u03b3\u03b42 T cells recognize infected red blood cells (iRBCs) was uncertain. Here we show that iRBCs stained for the phosphoantigen sensor butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1). \u03b3\u03b42 T cells formed immune synapses and lysed iRBCs in a contact, phosphoantigen, BTN3A1 and degranulation-dependent manner, killing intracellular parasites. Granulysin released into the synapse lysed iRBCs and delivered death-inducing granzymes to the parasite. All intra-erythrocytic parasites were susceptible, but schizonts were most sensitive. A second protective \u03b3\u03b42 T cell mechanism was identified. In the presence of patient serum, \u03b3\u03b42 T cells phagocytosed and degraded opsonized iRBCs in a CD16-dependent manner, decreasing parasite multiplication.

%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;2;;Cell;20-08-2020;"Maternal decidual NK (dNK) cells promote placentation, but how they protect against placental infection while maintaining fetal tolerance is unclear. Here we show that human dNK cells highly express the antimicrobial peptide granulysin (GNLY) and selectively transfer it via nanotubes to extravillous trophoblasts to kill intracellular Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) without killing the trophoblast. Transfer of GNLY, but not other cell death-inducing cytotoxic granule proteins, strongly inhibits Lm in human placental cultures and in mouse and human trophoblast cell lines. Placental and fetal Lm loads are lower and pregnancy success is greatly improved in pregnant Lm-infected GNLY-transgenic mice than in wild-type mice that lack GNLY. This immune defense is not restricted to pregnancy; peripheral NK (pNK) cells also transfer GNLY to kill bacteria in macrophages and dendritic cells without killing the host cell. Nanotube transfer of GNLY allows dNK to protect against infection while leaving the maternal-fetal barrier intact.";https://www-cell-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30884-9
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;3;;Journal of Immunology;06-05-2020;"Decidual NK cells (dNK) are the main lymphocyte population in early pregnancy decidual mucosa. Although dNK decrease during pregnancy, they remain present in decidual tissues at term. First trimester dNK facilitate trophoblast invasion, provide protection against infections, and were shown to have many differences in their expression of NKRs, cytokines, and cytolytic capacity compared with peripheral blood NK cells (pNK). However, only limited data are available on the phenotype and function of term pregnancy dNK. In this study, dNK from human term pregnancy decidua basalis and decidua parietalis tissues were compared with pNK and first trimester dNK. Profound differences were found, including: 1) term pregnancy dNK have an increased degranulation response to K562 and PMA/ionomycin but lower capacity to respond to human CMV\u2013infected cells; 2) term pregnancy dNK are not skewed toward recognition of HLA-C, as was previously shown for first trimester dNK; and 3) protein and gene expression profiles identified multiple differences between pNK, first trimester, and term pregnancy dNK, suggesting term pregnancy dNK are a distinct type of NK cells. Understanding the role of dNK throughout pregnancy is of high clinical relevance for studies aiming to prevent placental inflammatory disorders as well as maternal-to-fetal transmission of pathogens.";https://www.jimmunol.org/content/early/2020/05/05/jimmunol.1901435
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;4;08;PNAS;09-01-2018;Understanding how decidual CD8+ T cell (CD8+ dT) cytotoxicity is regulated and how these cells integrate the competing needs for maternal-fetal tolerance and immunity to infection is an important research and clinical goal. Gene-expression analysis of effector-memory CD8+ dT demonstrated a mixed transcriptional signature of T cell dysfunction, activation, and effector function. High protein expression of coinhibitory molecules PD1, CTLA4, and LAG3, accompanied by low expression of cytolytic molecules suggests that the decidual microenvironment reduces CD8+ dT effector responses to maintain tolerance to fetal antigens. However, CD8+ dT degranulated, proliferated, and produced IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, perforin, and granzymes upon in vitro stimulation, demonstrating that CD8+ dT are not permanently suppressed and retain the capacity to respond to proinflammatory events, such as infections. The balance between transient dysfunction of CD8+ dT that are permissive of placental and fetal development, and reversal of this dysfunctional state, is crucial in understanding the etiology of pregnancy complications and prevention of congenital infections.;https://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/385.long
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;5;02-01;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences;01-12-2016;The etiology of pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth, and preeclampsia are largely unknown. The combination of the maternal Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor-2DS1 (KIR2DS1) with fetal HLA-C was identified as a factor determining risk of pregnancy complications. Thus decidual natural killer cells (dNK) that express high levels of KIR may have a predominant role in pregnancy outcome. Although the dNK effect has been associated with cytokine and growth factor production to promote placentation, here we show that the combination of maternal KIR and HLA-C is also a factor that determines protection against placental human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections. Expression of KIR2DS1 by dNK increases the cytotoxic response of dNK to HLA-C2+ HCMV-infected maternal decidual stromal cells, preventing viral spread and placental pathology.;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/52/15072.abstract
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;6;08;Journal of Reproductive Immunology;02-08-2016;To establish a healthy pregnancy the maternal immune system must tolerate fetal allo-antigens, yet remain competent to respond to infections. The ability of decidual NK cells (dNK) to promote migration of fetal extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) and placental growth as well as the capacity of EVT to promote immune tolerance are topics of high interest and extensive research. However, the problem of how dNK and decidual CD8+ T cells (CD8+ dT) provide immunity to infections of the placenta and the mechanisms that regulate their cytolytic function has thus far largely been ignored. Fetal EVT are the most invasive cells of the placenta and directly interact with maternal decidual immune cells at this maternal-fetal interface. Besides the expression of non-polymorphic HLA-E and HLA-G molecules that are associated with immune tolerance, EVT also express highly polymorphic HLA-C molecules that can serve as targets for maternal dNK and CD8+ dT responses. HLA-C expression by EVT has a dual role as the main molecule to which immune tolerance needs to be established and as the only molecule that can present pathogen-derived peptides and provide protective immunity when EVT are infected. The focus of this review is to address the regulation of cytotoxicity of dNK and CD8+ dT, which is essential for maternal-fetal immune tolerance as well as recent evidence that both cell types can provide immunity to infections at the maternal-fetal interface. A particular emphasis is given to the role of HLA-C expressed by EVT and its capacity to elicit dNK and CD8+ dT responses.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037816300857
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;7;;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA;27-10-2015;The interaction of noncytotoxic decidual natural killer cells (dNK) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) at the maternal-fetal interface was studied. Confocal microscopy revealed that many dNK interact with a single large EVT. Filamentous projections from EVT enriched in HLA-G were shown to contact dNK, and may represent the initial stage of synapse formation. As isolated, 2.5% of dNK contained surface HLA-G. However, surface HLA-G-negative dNK contained internalized HLA-G. Activation of dNK resulted in the disappearance of internalized HLA-G in parallel with restoration of cytotoxicity. Surface HLA-G was reacquired by incubation with EVT. This HLA-G cycle of trogocytosis, endocytosis, degradation, and finally reacquisition provides a transient and localized acquisition of new functional properties by dNK upon interaction with EVT. Interruption of the cycle by activation of dNK by cytokines and/or viral products serves to ensure the NK control of virus infection at the interface, and is illustrated here by the response of dNK to human cytomegalo virus (HCMV)-infected decidual stromal cells.

Besides its main neuropathological hallmarks, a dysfunctional homeostasis of transition metals has been reported to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Dysregulation of iron (Fe) metabolism in AD has been suggested, particularly at the level of cellular iron efflux. Herein, we intended to further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Fe homeostasis in AD. In order to achieve this goal, the expression of specific Fe metabolism-related genes directly involved in Fe regulation and export was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 73 AD patients and 74 controls by quantitative PCR. The results obtained showed a significant decrease in the expression of aconitase 1 (ACO1; P = 0.007); ceruloplasmin (CP; P < 0.001) and amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP; P = 0.006) genes in AD patients compared with healthy volunteers. These observations point out to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes associated with ferroportin-mediated cellular Fe export in PBMCs from AD patients, when compared to controls. Taken together, these findings support previous studies suggesting impairment of Fe homeostasis in AD, which may lead to cellular Fe retention and oxidative stress, a typical feature of this disease.";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443915002094
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;9;;PNAS;09-06-2015;Invading human leukocyte antigen-G+ (HLA-G+) extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) are rare cells that are believed to play a key role in the prevention of a maternal immune attack on foreign fetal tissues. Here highly purified HLA-G+ EVT and HLA-G- villous trophoblasts (VT) were isolated. Culture on fibronectin that EVT encounter on invading the uterus increased HLA-G, EGF-Receptor-2, and LIF-Receptor expression on EVT, presumably representing a further differentiation state. Microarray and functional gene set enrichment analysis revealed a striking immune-activating potential for EVT that was absent in VT. Cocultures of HLA-G+ EVT with sample matched decidual natural killer cells (dNK), macrophages, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were established. Interaction of EVT with CD4+ T cells resulted in increased numbers of CD4+CD25(HI)FOXP3+CD45RA+ resting regulatory T cells (Treg) and increased the expression level of the Treg-specific transcription factor FOXP3 in these cells. However, EVT did not enhance cytokine secretion in dNK, whereas stimulation of dNK with mitogens or classical natural killer targets confirmed the distinct cytokine secretion profiles of dNK and peripheral blood NK cells (pNK). EVT are specialized cells involved in maternal-fetal tolerance, the properties of which are not imitated by HLA-G-expressing surrogate cell lines.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015573
%C3%A2ngela-crespo-ph-d-47723693;10;;Neurobiology of Aging;01-10-2013;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly individuals, resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Impaired brain iron homeostasis has been recognized as an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of this disease. Nevertheless, the knowledge gathered so far at the systemic level is clearly insufficient. Herein, we used an integrative approach to study iron metabolism in the periphery, at both genotypic and phenotypic levels, in a sample of 116 patients with AD and 89 healthy control subjects. To assess the potential impact of iron metabolism on the risk of developing AD, genetic analyses were performed along with the evaluation of the iron status profile in peripheral blood by biochemical and gene expression studies. The results obtained showed a significant decrease of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin concentrations in patients compared with the control subjects. Also, a significant decrease of ferroportin (SLC40A1) and both transferrin receptors TFRC and TFR2 transcripts was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients. At the genetic level, significant associations with AD were found for single nucleotide polymorphisms in TF, TFR2, ACO1, and SLC40A1 genes. Apolipoprotein E gene, a well-known risk factor for AD, was also found significantly associated with the disease in this study. Taken together, we hypothesize that the alterations on systemic iron status observed in patients could reflect an iron homeostasis dysregulation, particularly in cellular iron efflux. The intracellular iron accumulation would lead to a rise in oxidative damage, contributing to AD pathophysiology.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458013005460?via=ihub

%C5%9Feyla-azoz-ph-d-97156046;1;;Carbon;01-11-2015;A method for enhancing electronic performance of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin films through enhanced dispersion of SWCNTs in aqueous solutions is presented. The best dispersion enhancement is obtained by covalent attachment of urea to the acid functionalized SWCNTs. Dispersion properties of urea treatment are compared to conventional chemical and physical treatment techniques, such as surfactants. The treatment type and time significantly influence SWCNT surface functionalization, which determines the dispersion effectiveness as described by the SWCNT aggregate size, morphology and stability. The findings suggest that urea-SWCNTs, as compared to surfactant dispersed-SWCNTs, resulted in the most effective dispersion method among chemical treatments, yielding the smallest monodispersed aggregates with the most rod-like morphology that were stable over the greatest range in pH. Thin films prepared with SWCNT samples were evaluated for their transparency and resistance, two metrics that are important for electronics device applications. The urea-SWCNT films exhibited superior optoelectrical properties compared to SWCNT films prepared with conventional chemicals as well as surfactants. This indicates a correlation between degree of dispersibility and optoelectrical properties.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622315004947
%C5%9Feyla-azoz-ph-d-97156046;2;;ACS Langmuir;29-12-2014;A safe, scalable method for producing highly conductive aligned films of single-walled carbonnanotubes (SWNTs) from water suspensions is presented. While microfluidic assembly ofSWNTs has received significant interest, achieving desirable SWNT dispersion and morphologyin fluids without an insulating surfactant or toxic superacid is challenging. Different fromprevious fabrication techniques, we present a method, uniquely producing a non-corrosive inkthat can be directly applied to a device in situ. Functionalized SWNTs (f-SWNTs) are dispersedin an aqueous urea solution to leverage binding between the amine group of urea and thecarboxylic acid group of f-SWNTs and obtain urea-SWNT. Compared with SWNTs dispersedusing conventional methods (e.g. superacid and surfactants), the dispersed urea-SWNTaggregates have a higher aspect ratio with rod-like morphology as measured by light scattering.The Mayer Rod technique is used to prepare urea-SWNT, highly aligned films (2D nematicorder parameter of 0.6, 5 micron spotsize, via Polarized Raman) with resistance values as low as15-1700 ohms/sq in a transmittance range of 2-80% at 550 nm. These values compete with thebest literature values to date for conductivity of SWNT-enabled thin films. The findings offerpromising opportunities for industrial applications relying on highly conductive thin SWNTfilms.;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/la503919u

In this study, we present a novel method that enables the exchange of some of the organic capping agents on the QDs with carboxyl functionalized MWNTs upon ultrasonication. This produces a ligand-free covalent attachment of the QDs to the MWNTs.

The porous silicon of the channel walls functions in a manner analogous to the matrix in MALDI-MS, and is referred to as a desorption/ionization on silicon mass spectrometry (DIOS-MS) target when used in this configuration. Mass spectrometry signal intensity of substrate residue correlates with relative concentration, and position in the microchannel correlates with time, thus allowing determination of kinetic parameters. The system is especially suitable for initial reaction velocity determination. This microreactor is broadly applicable to time-resolved kinetic assays as long as at least one substrate or product of the reaction is ionizable by DIOS-MS.;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac8017586

The effect of varying the water to ethanol ratio in the reactant mixture was studied. The data from X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that with the addition of water, the cobalt metal particles were oxidized. X-ray diffraction analysis of CoCx suggests that the formation of amorphous carbon on the surface of the Co particles was suppressed. Cobalt magnetization measurements were performed to study the size and anisotropy of cobalt particles. Thermogravimetric analysis data demonstrate that with a water concentration of 7%, the yield increases by about 100% relative to pure ethanol synthesis. Raman and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopic data demonstrate that the SWCNT diameter increases (within the diameter range detected) with the water/ethanol ratio. From the statistical SWCNT diameter distribution obtained from transmission electron microscopy, 65% of the SWCNT synthesized with 20% water in ethanol have diameters larger than 1.5 nm, but there is a severe decrease in yield and a modest decrease in selectivity of SWCNT. The mechanism of how the water influences the yield and diameter of SWCNT is discussed.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951713003588

%C3%A1lvaro-castillo-4b0b8b25;1;;J. Phys. Org. Chem;01-01-2013;AbstractWe have performed high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations for aminoethene and the three isomeric 1,1- (Z)- or (E)-1,2-diaminoethenes as well as their singly and doubly charged cations derived by loss of electrons and/or upon protonation. Gas phase molecular structures were computed at the MP2/6-311 + G(3df,2p) level. Standard molar enthalpies of formation in the gas phase, at T= 298.15 K, were estimated using the G3 composite method and atomization, isodesmic and homodesmotic reactions. Other energetic parameters were also calculatedat the G3 level: proton af\ufb01nities, basicities and adiabatic ionization enthalpies. Theoretical and experimental data are compared. The reported experimental data refer only to aminoethenewherein the standard molar enthalpy of formation has a considerable uncertainty, although the molecular structure is well established. There are no such data, neither structural nor thermochemical, for any of the three isomeric diaminoethenes. Isoelectronic comparisons are made. For example, the diprotonated diaminoethenes are isoelectronic to isobutene and (Z)- and (E)-butene, while the doubly ionized diaminoethenes are likewise related to trimethylenemethaneand 1,3-butadiene;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/chem/agreer/Alec's%20pub'ed%20papers/2013%20J%20Phys%20Org%20Chem%20Miranda.pdf
%C3%A1lvaro-castillo-4b0b8b25;2;03;J. Phys. Org. Chem;01-01-2012;AbstractNanotubes are a class of host cavities increasingly used to encapsulate unstable molecules, yet none have been exploited to host reactive sulfur species, such as thiozone (S3). In this paper, density functional theory and (ONIOM) calculations were used to compute single\u2010walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)\u2013thiozone combinations for the inclusion of S3 into the hollow nanotube space and to rationalize when 1,2,3\u2010thiozonide formation can take place. Nanotube diameter selectivity for the isomerization of the C2v form of S3 to the D3h form proved to be elusive. Acyclic C2v S3 was ~6 kcal/mol more stable than cyclic D3h S3 whether it was free or encapsulated within an SWNT. 1,2,3\u2010Thiozonide formation took place on the convex side of nanotubes of low tube radii, such as the armchair (4,4) and (5,5) SWNTs. In terms of the reaction mode of C2v S3, the 1,3\u2010dipolar addition reaction was preferred compared with the [2 + 2] cycloaddition and chelotrope paths.;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/chem/agreer/Alec's%20pub'ed%20papers/2012%20Alvaro%20JPOC.pdf

%C3%A1lvaro-castillo-4b0b8b25;4;05;Tetrahedron;01-01-2011;AbstractWe present an experimental and computational study of the reaction of aryl substituted benzyl 1-alkynyl sul\ufb01des with potassium alkoxide in acetonitrile, which produces 2-aryl 2,3-dihydrothiophenes in poor to good yields. The cyclization is most ef\ufb01cient with electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring. Evidence indicates there is rapid exchange of protons and tautomerism of the alkynyl unit prior to cyclization. Theoretical calculations were also conducted to help rationalize the base induced 5-endo cyclization of benzyl 1-propynyl sul\ufb01de (1a). The potential energy surface was calculated for the formation of 2,3-dihydrothiophene in a reaction of benzyl 1-propynyl sul\ufb01de (1a) with potassium methoxide. Geometries were optimized with CAM-B3LYP/6-311\u00feG(d,p) in acetonitrile with the CPCM solvent model. It is signi\ufb01cant that the benzyl propa-1,2-dien-1-yl sulfane (6) possessed a lower benzylic proton af\ufb01nity than the benzyl prop-2-yn-1-yl sulfane (8) thus favoring the base induced reaction of the former. From benzyl(propa-1,2-dien-1-yl sulfane (6), 2,3-dihydrothiophene can be formed via a conjugate base that undergoes 5-endo-trig cyclization followed by a protonation step.;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/chem/agreer/Alec's%20pub'ed%20papers/2011%20tetrahedron%20Schwan.pdf
%C3%A1lvaro-castillo-4b0b8b25;5;;ChemBioChem;01-01-2009;Abstractb-Lactam synthetase (b-LS) is the paradigm of a growing class of enzymes that form the critical b-lactam ring in the clavam and carbapenem antibiotics. b-LS catalyzes a two-stage reaction in which N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-l-arginine is first adenylated, and then undergoes intramolecular ring closure. It was previously shown that the forward kinetic commitment to b-lactam formation is high, and that the overall rate of reaction is partially limited to a protein conformational change rather than to the chemical step alone of closing the strained ring. b-Lactam formation was evaluated on the basis of X-ray crystal structures, site-specific mutation, and kinetic and computational studies. The combined evidence clearly points to a reaction coordinate involving the formation of a tetrahedral transition state/intermediate stabilized by a conserved Lys. The combination of substrate preorganization, a well-stabilized transition state and an excellent leaving group facilitates this acyl substitution to account for the strong forward commitment to catalysis and to lower the barrier of four-membered ring formation to the magnitude of a protein conformational change.;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/chem/agreer/Alec's%20pub'ed%20papers/2009%20ChemBioChem.pdf

Monte Carlo and ONIOM calculations that incorporated semi-empirical and density functional theory predicted the conformational in\ufb02uence of the polymethylene chain in the cycloreversion of dioxapaddlane, 1,4-diicosa naphthalene-1,4-endoperoxide, to 1O2 and 1,4-diicosa naphthalene. This study attempts to build a connection between 1O2 generation and \u2018\u2018jump rope\u2019\u2019 dynamics of the dioxapaddlane.The polymethylene chain appears to function as a gatekeeper for the oxygen. Instead of coming full circle, a semi-circle rotation of the polymethylene bridge protected the peroxide group, limiting the dissociation of 1O2 from the naphthalene site.;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/chem/agreer/Alec's%20pub'ed%20papers/2009%20Jump%20Rope.pdf

Computational studies were conducted on radicals and diradicals from mercaptoand bismercaptocatechols to provide insight into their relative stability. The loss of a hydrogen atom from mercapto- or -bismercaptocatechol produces S- and O-centered radicals of similar energy. The loss of two hydrogen atoms from 3,4-bismercaptocatechol (3) is an example where a number of quinone and diradical structures become possible. However, the energetics are consistent with a 4-membered ring dithiete playing an important role in the two electron oxidation reaction of 3;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/chem/agreer/Alec's%20pub'ed%20papers/2008%20J%20Sulfur%20Chem%20Alvaro2.pdf

Unfortunately, current methods for computing footprint cause integer factors of slowdown and are therefore difficult to use with realistic inputs. Current methods are slow because they are based on software tracing of load instructions and data addresses. We present an approach that combines lightweight measurements and static binary analysis. We use static analysis to reason about each load's expected reuse. We then calculate the footprint for each loop using inference rules informed by measurements from common performance counters. We validate our method on benchmarks that vary access patterns (strided vs. unpredictable), reuse (varying and repeated accesses per element), and sparsity (all words in a cache line vs. some). For strided patterns, errors are within 1%; for unpredictable ones, errors are 5-10%. Our overheads are under 10%. A tool based on software tracing has an error of less than 1%, but either introduces at least 130\u00d7 overhead or hangs.";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8891025

%C3%B6zg%C3%BCr-ozan-k%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7-154a7676;3;;IEEE MASCOTS 2018;25-09-2018;Abstract: Virtual Machines (VM) frequently run parallel applications in cloud environments, and high performance computing platforms. It is well known that configuring a VM with too many virtual processors (vCPUs) worsens application performance due to scheduling cross-talk between the hypervisor and the guest OS. Specifically, when the number of vCPUs assigned to a VM exceeds available physical CPUs then parallel applications in the VM experience worse performance, even when number of application threads remains fixed. In this paper, we first track the root cause of this performance loss to inefficient hypervisor-level emulation of inter-vCPU synchronization events. We then present three techniques to minimize hypervisor-induced overheads on parallel workloads in large-VCPU VMs. The first technique pins application threads to dedicated vCPUs to eliminate inter-vCPU thread migrations, reducing the overhead of emulating inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). The second technique para-virtualizes inter-vCPU TLB flush operations. The third technique enables faster reactivation of idle vCPUs by prioritizing the delivery of rescheduling IPIs. Unlike existing solutions which rely on heavyweight and slow vCPU hotplug mechanisms, our techniques are lightweight and provide more flexibility in migrating large-vCPU VMs. Using several parallel benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our prototype implementation in the Linux KVM/QEMU virtualization platform. Specifically, we demonstrate that with our techniques, parallel applications can maintain their performance even when up to 255 VCPUs are assigned to a VM running on as few as 6 physical cores.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8526900/authors

Astell\u2019s solution is to allow women to withdraw from society into dedicated schools for women and by women, as an alternative to marriage and family life. In this paper, I will explore some of the implications of that argument, how it might be expanded to other marginalized populations,...;http://commons.emich.edu/ac/vol4/iss1/4/

This research is concerned with international construction projects. In particular, it investigates the impact of local knowledge on the client value system. Workshops were organised on 12 international projects in the western Balkans region. The initial client value system was captured by using a paired comparison exercise. Next, local knowledge information was introduced, and the EFTE (Estimate-Feedback-Talk-Estimate) technique was used to capture the revised client value system. The changes in the two sets of client value systems were analysed. The results indicate that 4 parameters (Scope, Contract-admin, Human resources and Health and Safety) out of 8 changed and that the changes were statistically significant. Local knowledge can be used to impact client value system.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3846/13923730.2014.945950

Using a gridded three-dimensional cloud comparison in CloudCompare software, abrasion wear thickness of shoes was identified using the CIE-L-a-b colour system that is interpolated with the physical formula representation of colours. After obtaining the thickness lost, other wear factors like the material properties of the shoe sole, the runners\u2019 personal profile and the running schedule were combined for wear projection. The methodological process from a non-destructive wear detection to wear projection allows shoe manufacturers to reduce the iterations of wear testing while maximizing the entire analysis of shoe wear. Shoe samples were kindly sponsored by ASICS Institute of Sport Science.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1754337118755270

A 3 dimensional (3D) scanning approach together with a commercial software, CloudCompare Mesh Cloud Comparison was utilized for this study. In CloudCompare, a grid system and colored scale was applied to identify the region and extend of abrasion of the shoe-sole. This study clearly showed the extent of abrasion on regions of shoe-sole identified from the colored scale.

aaronwlee;1;;ICOMP'16 Conference;27-08-2016;This paper describes an innovative method to implement location-based filtering of streaming GPS point data without the use of a geospatial database or GIS engine.  The filtering algorithm takes a set of polygons as input, and generates an approximating shape of a specified relative accuracy as output, consisting of a union of rectangles. These rectangles can be used to perform point-in-polygon comparisons quickly using text-based pattern matching in a pub/sub messaging system, which excels at handling streaming data at scale. This method has applicability in transportation, logistics, smart cities, security, and surveillance, and can be generalized to one or three dimensions.;null
aaronwlee;2;;Springer - Algorithms and Data Structures: WADS 2007 Proceedings;31-08-2007;Based on my Masters thesis.\n\nGiven a set P of points in the plane and a set L of non-crossing line segments whose endpoints are in P, a constrained plane geometric graph is a plane graph whose vertex set is P and whose edge set contains L. An edge e has the \u03b1-visible diamond property if one of the two isosceles triangles with base e and base angle \u03b1 does not contain any points of P visible to both endpoints of e. A constrained plane geometric graph has the d-good polygon property provided that for every pair x,y of visible vertices on a face f, the shorter of the two paths from x to y around the boundary has length at most d\u00b7|xy|. If a constrained plane geometric graph has the \u03b1-visible diamond property for each of its edges and the d-good polygon property, we show it is a 8d(\u03c0\u2212\u03b1)2\u03b12sin2(\u03b1/4)8d(\u03c0\u2212\u03b1)2\u03b12sin2\u2061(\u03b1/4)-spanner of the visibility graph of P and L. This is a generalization of the result by Das and Joseph [3] to the constrained setting as well as a slight improvement on their spanning ratio of 8d\u03c02\u03b12sin2(\u03b1/4)8d\u03c02\u03b12sin2\u2061(\u03b1/4). We then show that several well-known constrained triangulations (namely the constrained Delaunay triangulation, constrained greedy triangulation and constrained minimum weight triangulation) have the \u03b1-visible diamond property for some constant \u03b1. In particular, we show that the greedy triangulation has the \u03c0/6-visible diamond property, which is an improvement over previous results.;null

This knowledge is not available in books and documents but is rather embedded within the specialists in the form of experience, tacit and heuristic knowledge. It is empirical that this knowledge be made more approachable and reusable for transfer.

There has been extensive research in this field and it has been a consistent application domain in the automotive sector. Recent times have seen the emergence of a large number of public datasets corresponding to different countries, over which traffic sign detection and recognition techniques are being employed. We present a survey paper which involves a comprehensive study of existing techniques being used, along with a performance analysis over different datasets. We also discuss the trade-off of the different options in terms of accuracy and recognition time.;https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v5i5/NOV163967.pdf

'Re-Visioning Terrorism: An Interdisciplinary and International Conference', 8-10 September 2011, Purdue University;08-10-2011;Code Geass (Taniguchi 2006-08) is an epic-length Japanese anime that forms the center of a multimedia franchise. It focuses on a heroic terrorist\u2019s efforts to free Japan from colonial occupation, and references real-world events such as the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo. Yet, Code Geass treats these plot elements in a cursory fashion, interweaving them with situations which include absurdly giant mecha robots and high school romantic comedy. Thus this paper argues that Code Geass represents \u201cblockbuster terrorism\u201d, symptomatic of how the popular media oversimplifies the complex political issue of terrorism for commercial reasons;null

aaronchooi;1;;Association for Computing Machinery;01-01-2021;In this investigation we present a material driven inquiry into fibreglass and the hand lay-up technique of composite lamination, as well as its affordances for the development of a tangible user interface. This was achieved by taking an in-depth look at woven fibreglass and its propensities as a craft material through its varying states of pliable fabric, wetted mesh and hardened composite. Through this, we propose the potential design of a pressure activated fibreglass skin for rigid and semi rigid fibreglass structures. Primarily through the means of a tri layer laminated fibreglass structure, with a polypyrrole treated fibreglass core sandwiched between 2 embroidered conductive fibreglass layers.;https://doi.org/10.1145/3430524.3444703

aaron-angler;2;07;The Smart Local;04-07-2019;You may have caught bae\u2019s heart, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should stop fishing for opportunities to be closer. Try Fever\u2019s kayak fishing tour where you and your partner can try your hand at fishing from a kayak. You can opt for two individual kayaks, but if the both of you are an inseparable pair, you\u2019ll also be able to get cosy in a single kayak.The tours vary in location and distance. The Playground is great for first-timers who are new to paddle boating and fishing, as it covers an achievable distance of 2- 4km. You may even spot (and catch) different species of fish like groupers, snappers and flatheads!For couples who wish to dive into the deep end of being adventurous, check out the Island Hopper option. As its name suggests, you\u2019ll be island-hopping from Sentosa to the Southern Islands where you can see vibrant reefs and untouched beaches. This journey will take 4-5 hours and you\u2019ll be able to snag queenfish and mackerel.Find out more about the different packages here.Pro tip: Wear lots of sunscreen as you\u2019re going to be exposed out at sea for several hours.Rates: From $159/2 pax;https://thesmartlocal.com/read/outdoor-couple-activities/

aashimatyagi;1;;Kaleidoscope Magazine;10-08-2018;During the pre-industrial revolution, every village produced what it needed to consume. This was in itself a significant departure from the time when every household produced most of what it required, until after the concept of barter changed it all. With the steam revolution coming into beingfrom 1830s onwards, the first unbundling occurred on account of which production and consumptioncould take place in two separate locations, which in turn could be at a real distance of each other. The second unbundling was the result of the advent of communication and transport technology from 1980s onwards that allowed far flung distances to be connected in a matter of moments.;http://www.scopeonline.in/SCOPE-pdf/August-2018-Issue.pdf
aashimatyagi;2;;Kaleidoscope Magazine;28-11-2016;If India decides to consume steel that is \u201cMade in India\u201d, then we need to rely on developing our own globally competitive Steel Enterprises. The Government of India has recognised this and remained supportive of the growth of the industry. It has, on merit considerations, imposed trade remedial measures that have provided much needed stability to the industry. At the same time, the Industry needs to focus strongly on achieving market leadership, reflecting cost competitiveness and affordability.Let there be Steel: Safe Steel, More Steel, Indian Steel;http://www.scopeonline.in/SCOPE-pdf/November-2016-Issue-28th-Nov.pdf
aashimatyagi;3;2025;Indian Institute of Metals;15-11-2015;As against stagnating demand for steel across the developed world, global steel-making capacity has reached surplus levels in recent years, to a major extent on account of China. On the other hand, notwithstanding the challenges such as surging imports, high cost of finance and domestic infrastructural constraints, Indian steel enterprises have continued to remain globally competitive and have invested heavily in new capacity, new product lines, advanced technology and automation. The Government of India\u2019s Vision of reaching, by 2025-26, a level of 300 MTPA capacity from the current 110 MTPA, is ambitious, but reflects very well its strong commitment to the growth of the steel industry in India.

It has become an industry standard to measure tenant satisfaction, commonly called customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction has become the widely used metric to manage customer loyalty (Keiningham, Gupta, Aksoy, & Buoye, 2014). The aim of this research is to determine the impact of property management services on tenants\u2019 satisfaction with the three identified variables i.e. facility management, perceived quality and lease management. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to build constructs and test the hypotheses with the collected survey samples. Of the three variables, facility management is the most influential factor that leads to tenant satisfaction with industrial buildings. Next, perceived quality is another important factor that contributes to tenants\u2019 pleasure. Compared with these two, lease management fares worse, having the least extensive effect on tenant satisfaction, and could be disregarded. The ultimate impact of tenant satisfaction is about tenant retention and recommendation. The overall findings of this research will potentially help real estate developers to develop a better property management system, leasing program and tenant retention strategy.;http://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201716463831087.page

4abhinavjain;2;2009;American Chemical Society - Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research;31-08-2007;Run-to-run (RtR) control is an important quality assurance method for batch-based manufacturing process. Usually, products of different grades are produced on a tool that will experience gradual drift between maintenance cycles. A feed-forward/feedback RtR control strategy that compensates this drift for all products manufactured on this tool was proposed. This and other RtR control schemes were analyzed and validated by simulation and experimentally using a bench scale reactor that produces silica particles with different diameters by a sol\u2212gel process. A simple EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) RtR control scheme based on products of the same grade was found to be stable but inefficient for infrequent products. A simple EWMA RtR control scheme that attributed disturbance entirely as the effect of tool drift was found to be unstable. The feed-forward/feedback RtR control proposed was able to maintain stable quality by effectively utilizing information about tool changes to adjust recipes of infrequent products.;http://doi.org/10.1021/ie070250p

a-tikah-ali-985444181;1;;Particle and fibre toxicology;20-12-2018;Our development and usage of engineered nanomaterials has grown exponentially despite concerns about their unfavourable cardiorespiratory consequence, one that parallels ambient ultrafine particle exposure from vehicle emissions. Most research in the field has so far focused on airway inflammation in response to nanoparticle inhalation, however, little is known about nanoparticle-microbiome interaction in the human airway and the environment. Emerging evidence illustrates that the airway, even in its healthy state, is not sterile. The resident human airway microbiome is further altered in chronic inflammatory respiratory disease however little is known about the impact of nanoparticle inhalation on this airway microbiome. The composition of the airway microbiome, which is involved in the development and progression of respiratory disease is dynamic, adding further complexity to understanding microbiota-host interaction in the lung, particularly in the context of nanoparticle exposure. This article reviews the size-dependent properties of nanomaterials, their body deposition after inhalation and factors that influence their fate. We evaluate what is currently known about nanoparticle-microbiome interactions in the human airway and summarise the known clinical, immunological and toxicological consequences of this relationship. While associations between inhaled ambient ultrafine particles and host immune-inflammatory response are known, the airway and environmental microbiomes likely act as intermediaries and facilitate individual susceptibility to inhaled nanoparticles and toxicants. Characterising the precise interaction between the environment and airway microbiomes, inhaled nanoparticles and the host immune system is therefore critical and will provide insight into mechanisms promoting nanoparticle induced airway damage.;null
a-tikah-ali-985444181;2;;International Journal of Molecular Sciences;09-11-2019;"1) Background: Firm consensus has yet to be established in relation to taxonomic classification and primer choice in targeted amplicon sequencing of the mycobiome. While the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region are recognized as the formal fungal taxonomic barcode, appraisal of different ITS sub-regions and the influence of DNA extraction methods have not been comprehensively undertaken using human respiratory specimens. (2) Methods: We performed ITS analysis of respiratory (sputum) samples by assessing (a) the effect of alternate DNA extraction techniques and (b) an evaluation of four different ITS primer pairs (ITS1F and ITS2; ITS1-30F and ITS1-217R; gITS7ngs and ITS4ng; and Fseq and Rseq) on the mycobiome profiles generated for mock fungal communities and their respective clinical (airway) specimens. (3) Results: Primer pairs varied in their resulting ITS mycobiome profiles, suggesting that particular pairs may be more relevant for analysis of respiratory samples compared to others. Assessment of DNA extraction methods highlighted lower final DNA concentrations achieved by mechanical disruption compared to enzymatic lysis. However, despite lower yields, DNA liberated by mechanical lysis more readily yielded ITS bands with highest success in combination with the Fseq and Rseq primers. (4) Conclusion: Choice of extraction method, primers used, and sequencing approach are all important considerations in sequencing the mycobiome and should be tailored to sample type. A standardization of approach to mycobiome studies using respiratory specimens will permit more reliable comparisons between studies and improve our understanding of the role of fungi in the human airway.";null
a-tikah-ali-985444181;3;;Environmental science & technology;18-03-2020;Abstract\nLaser printers emit high levels of nanoparticles (PM0.1) during operation. Although it is well established that toners contain multiple engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), little is known about inhalation exposures to these nanoparticles and work practices in printing centers. In this report, we present a comprehensive inhalation exposure assessment of indoor microenvironments at six commercial printing centers in Singapore, the first such assessment outside of the United States, using real-time personal and stationary monitors, time-integrated instrumentation, and multiple analytical methods. Extensive presence of ENMs, including titanium dioxide, iron oxide, and silica, was detected in toners and in airborne particles collected from all six centers studied. We document high transient exposures to emitted nanoparticles (peaks of \u223c500\u202f000 particles/cm3, lung-deposited surface area of up to 220 \u03bcm2/cm3, and PM0.1 up to 16 \u03bcg/m3) with complex PM0.1 chemistry that included 40-60 wt % organic carbon, 10-15 wt % elemental carbon, and 14 wt % trace elements. We also record 271.6-474.9 pmol/mg of Environmental Protection Agency-priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These findings highlight the potentially high occupational inhalation exposures to nanoparticles with complex compositions resulting from widespread usage of nano-enabled toners in the printing industry, as well as inadequate ENM-specific exposure control measures in these settings.;null
a-tikah-ali-985444181;4;;Mycopathologia;01-02-2020;Fungal disease is an increasingly recognised global clinical challenge associated with high mortality. Early diagnosis of fungal infection remains problematic due to the poor sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic modalities. Advances in sequencing technologies hold promise in addressing these shortcomings and for improved fungal detection and identification. To translate such emerging approaches into mainstream clinical care will require refinement of current sequencing and analytical platforms, ensuring standardisation and consistency through robust clinical benchmarking and its validation across a range of patient populations. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss current diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with fungal disease and provide key examples where the application of sequencing technologies has potential diagnostic application in assessing the human 'mycobiome'. We assess how ready access to fungal sequencing may be exploited in broadening our insight into host-fungal interaction, providing scope for clinical diagnostics and the translation of emerging mycobiome research into clinical practice.;null

In this cross domain priming paradigm, the participants are asked to rate how much they like the stimulus images, on a 7-point Likert scale, after being subliminally exposed to masked lexical prime words, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Statistical analysis tools are used to analyze the effect of priming on behavior, and machine learning techniques to infer the primes from EEGs. The experiment reveals strong effects of subliminal priming on the participants' explicit rating of images. The subjective judgment affected by the priming makes visible change in event-related potentials (ERPs); results show larger ERP amplitude for the negative primes compared with positive and neutral primes. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers are proposed to infer the prime types from the average ERPs, which yields a classification rate of 70%%.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractSimilar.jsp?arnumber=6944856

aagrawal00;3;;35th IEEE EMBC 2013, Osaka, Japan;null;The effect of affective priming on the subjective perception of images is investigated through questionnaires and electroencephalographic (EEG) markers. Subjects were asked to rate how much they like pictures on a 7-point likert scale, while EEG of the subjects was recorded simultaneously. Prior to the presentation of the pictures, masked lexical prime words (positive, negative, neutral) were presented for very short intervals (34ms). The objective of those prime words is to elicit an affective state which would bias subject's judgment of the pictures. It is found that subliminal lexical primes strongly affect both the subjective judgment of pictures and also the EEG. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that the subliminal prime type (positive, negative, neutral) can be inferred reliably from average ERPs using multi-class support vector machines in wavelet domain, yielding classification rates of 70%%;http://embc.embs.org/files/2013/3027_FI.pdf

And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.Home Credit GroupHome Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\nShow moreShow less;null

Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival.One year ago, the office of the U.S. Vice President spearheaded a bold new initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, to make a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years.In 2017, the Data Science Bowl will be a critical milestone in support of the Cancer Moonshot by convening the data science and medical communities to develop lung cancer detection algorithms.Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.This year, the Data Science Bowl will award $1 million in prizes to those who observe the right patterns, ask the right questions, and in turn, create unprecedented impact around cancer screening care and prevention. The funds for the prize purse will be provided by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.\nShow moreShow less;null

aaron-lim-b30898135;1;;Behavior Research Methods;20-09-2021;Missing data is a common occurrence in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Much work had evaluated the performance of different techniques when all observed variables were either continuous or ordinal. However, few have investigated these techniques when observed variables are a mix of continuous and ordinal variables. This study investigated the performance of four approaches to handling missing data in these models: a joint ordinal-continuous full information maximum likelihood (FIML) approach and three multiple imputation approaches (fully conditional specification, fully conditional specification with latent variable formulation, and expectation-maximization with bootstrapping) combined with the weighted least squares with mean and variance adjustment (WLSMV) estimator. In a Monte-Carlo simulation, the FIML approach produced unbiased estimations of factor loadings and standard errors in almost all conditions. Fully conditional specification combined with WLSMV was second best, producing accurate estimates when the sample size was large. However, FIML encountered slight non-convergence issues when certain ordinal categories have extremely low frequencies, which is typical of skewed data. If the sample is large, fully conditional specification combined with weighted least squares is recommended when the FIML approach is not feasible (e.g., non-convergence, impractical computation durations, and variables that predict missingness are not of interest to the analysis).;https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01582-w

aakritiagarwal;6;;2014 Voices Conference by Global Tech Women;08-03-2014;Process changes are complex and not for the faint of heart. They require strategy, investment, and tailored application to guarantee success. The Agile methodology and its processes have hit mainstream across a variety of industries. Implementing Agile in your environment becomes even harder when it is misunderstood as an recipe or set of practices to be followed rather than a set of principles with numerous and varied applications. Coordinating people, process, and tool changes, which require thinking and behavioral adjustments, brings a level of complexity to any organization that requires a high investment but can reap great rewards. This panel will discuss effective ways of leveraging this development methodology to increase collaboration, keeping into account, cultural differences that we come across in our diverse workplaces.;http://www.globaltechwomen.com/speakers-2014.html

briony-croft-874aa38a;1;;Scientific Reports;27-05-2021;"Urban noise pollution is an emerging public health concern in growing cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but the sound environment in SSA cities is understudied. We leveraged a large-scale measurement campaign to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of measured sound levels and sound sources in Accra, Ghana. We measured sound levels and recorded audio clips at 146 representative locations, involving 7-days (136 locations) and 1-year measurements between 2019 and 2020. We calculated metrics of noise levels and intermittency and analyzed audio recordings using a pre-trained neural network to identify sources. Commercial, business, and industrial areas and areas near major roads had the highest median daily sound levels (LAeq24hr: 69 dBA and 72 dBA) and the lowest percentage of intermittent sound; the vice-versa was found for peri urban areas. Road-transport sounds dominated the overall sound environment but mixtures of other sound sources, including animals, human speech, and outdoor music, dominated in various locations and at different times. Environmental noise levels in Accra exceeded both international and national health-based guidelines. Detailed information on the acoustical environmental quality (including sound levels and types) in Accra may guide environmental policy formulation and evaluation to improve the health of urban residents.";https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90454-6

Workshop on Railway Noise, Ghent, Belgium;16-09-2019;The STARDAMP software tool enables prediction and assessment of the performance of wheel and rail dampers. This paper supports ongoing validation and testing efforts by examining the use of STARDAMP in relation to assessing the performance of rail dampers on slab track with highly resilient fasteners. This track type is common on transit systems that are increasingly considering rail dampers for noise control. The normal assessment approach of summing a measured undamped TDR with a damped short rail DR may under-predict the rail damper benefit for some slab tracks. Alternatively the damper effect may be estimated by summing the predicted undamped TDRs with a damped DR from a short rail test, supported by investigations of the dominant rolling noise frequencies. The STARDAMP slab track model may limit the accuracy of rolling noise prediction by ignoring baseplate dynamic effects.;null
briony-croft-874aa38a;3;2013;Conference on Railway Excellence Sydney, Australia 30 April \u2013 2 May 2018;01-01-2018;Rail dampers are a rolling noise mitigation measure developed in Europe.  The first field trials of this track component have previously been undertaken in Australia (Sydney).  There, rail dampers have been shown to offer a moderate noise reduction of around 4 dB for passenger trains on slab track and resilient fasteners. On typical ballasted tracks in Sydney rail dampers are less effective and have not been found to be a cost-effective noise control measure.The benefit achievable through rail dampers varies considerably between different systems, depending on the design of the wheel and track.   STARDAMP is a modelling tool to predict the noise reduction achievable by rail dampers (or wheel dampers) in a particular situation.This paper presents a study predicting the noise reduction provided by rail dampers on highly resilient slab track and on ballasted track, and comparing model results with field measurements in Perth.  Both model and measurements demonstrate that noise from the Perth metropolitan passenger train network can be effectively attenuated using rail dampers.  In terms of overall A-weighted levels, a rolling noise reduction of up to 5 dB was identified for passenger trains on ballasted track.  In a tunnel situation with slab track (Pandrol Vanguard), a rolling noise reduction of up to 8 dB was achieved.The paper outlines the modelling and field measurement approaches taken and the results of the Perth rail damper trials.  The methods represent an advance in railway environmental impact assessment and forecasting noise control performance that could be applied to rail systems elsewhere.;null
briony-croft-874aa38a;4;;Noise and Vibration Mitigation for Rail Transportation Systems - Springer;01-01-2018;For many rail noise practitioners, \u201crail noise policy\u201d is synonymous with \u201cnoise limits\u201d or numerical criteria to be applied in various situations.  In this context, the task of reviewing rail noise policies around the world might be simplistically reduced to tables and lists of numbers.  However, the intention of this state of the art review is to address the broader policy picture. This has as much to do with how (and why) rail noise is managed and regulated, and how rail noise reduction is achieved, as it does with limits and criteria.This paper describes the strategic approach taken by rail networks and regulatory authorities in managing rail noise internationally. It includes review of policies, and the instruments through which regulations are implemented (including noise criteria, limits, access charges etc).  The geographic scope of the review primarily encompasses Europe, North America and Australia, with some limited discussion of other areas.The paper considers how noise policy is applied in a range of contexts, such as new rail projects, upgraded / expanded rail projects, developments near railways, new / upgraded rolling stock, and existing rail operations (including noise abatement).  In each geographical region, the key existing and historical rail noise issues are discussed, to understand why particular policies and approaches have been developed, and how effective those policies have been.  The outlook for future rail noise policies around the world is also considered.;null
briony-croft-874aa38a;5;2013;Noise and Vibration Mitigation for Rail Transportation Systems - Springer;01-01-2018;Measurements of ground vibration were taken in a rail tunnel and cross passage, before and after the installation of rail dampers.  In addition to lower in-car noise, measurements indicated an immediate reduction in ground vibration, attributed to the rail dampers.  While the most significant observed reduction in vibration was at frequencies above those of interest for ground-borne noise control (16 Hz to 250 Hz), a reduction in average vibration of up to 9 dB was recorded at 150 - 200 Hz.  This paper summarises the measurement results from two parallel rail tunnels.  One of the tunnels includes results with and without rail dampers.  Results from the opposite tunnel are used as a control data set.  As a shuttle service was in operation at the time of the measurements, the same rolling stock was utilised for both tracks.The Pipe-in-Pipe (PiP) model has been used in an attempt to reproduce the measured change in vibration due to the addition of rail dampers.  The initially selected model parameters reproduced the vibration reduction, but predicted it would occur at lower frequencies than indicated by the measurements, i.e. at 100 \u2013 150 Hz.  This simple model with the rail dampers represented as pure masses also suggested that vibration may increase above 160 Hz with the addition of rail dampers, but no increase was seen in the measurements at any frequency.  Adjusting the model parameters improved the correlation of the modelled and measured insertion gains.  Predictions were then made for the insertion gain on the surface immediately above the rail tunnel, to identify the potential for a change in ground-borne noise.  A potential modest reduction in surface vibration in a small frequency range around 160 Hz has been predicted as a result of rail damper installation in a tunnel.;null
briony-croft-874aa38a;6;;Acoustics 2017 Perth, Australia;01-11-2017;This paper presents an investigation of rolling noise emissions from trains operating on the Perth electrified passenger network, as an outcome of the Public Transport Authority's strategic initiatives in noise management. The study compared STARDAMP model results with field measurements for both ballasted and slab track, examining scenarios with and without rail dampers, and identified the contribution of track and rolling stock to overall rolling noise emissions. The work demonstrates that noise from the Perth metropolitan passenger train network can be effectively attenuated using rail dampers. A rolling noise reduction of up to 5 dB was predicted and measured for passenger trains on ballasted track. In a tunnel situation with Pandrol Vanguard slab track a reduction of up to 8 dB was achieved. The efficacy of rail dampers as a noise control measure in Perth is attributed to the Perth rolling stock wheel design and track support dynamic stiffness.;null
briony-croft-874aa38a;7;;Acoustics Australia / Australian Acoustical Society;01-12-2015;An environmental noise model, developed in specialist software such as LimA, SoundPLAN or CadnaA is typically at the core of noise impact assessments for rail projects. These software packages include rail noise modules that account for such variables as train speed and length, and propagation algorithms that allow large-scale models to reliably predict noise levels at thousands of receivers neighbouring the track. The ease with which results are generated by these software packages can easily provide a false sense of accuracy however, as the old maxim of noise modelling still applies\u2014garbage in equals garbage out. This is particularly the case for freight rail operations which involve complex noise sources. These include multiple moving noise sources, such as locomotive exhaust noise and rolling noise, that exhibit distinct relationships with train speed. There are localised sources such as crossovers and curve noise which have a particularly annoying character. There are sources that exhibit different characteristics under different operational scenarios. For example, locomotive noise can be dominated by the engine exhaust under traction on an uphill grade and ruled by dynamic brake noise on a downhill grade. This paper presents a discussion of issues to be considered to successfully model freight rail noise. It describes the different noise sources which apply, when they apply and how to incorporate them in a computer noise model. An outline is provided on the most appropriate propagation algorithms to apply and how sources such as curve noise and brake noise, can be accounted for. Attention is also given to validation of the noise model at each stage of its development, including how to make best use of noise measurements to verify model predictions.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40857-015-0029-0

This paper describes investigations into the locomotive noise and muffler performance, and the steps taken to re-design the muffler to optimise its performance. The objective was to reduce low frequency noise emissions to comply with the EPA licence requirements. The project achieved a reduction in overall Lmax noise levels of up to 5 dB in the highest engine notch settings. The low frequency benefit (in the 25 Hz and 50 Hz one-third octave frequency bands) was of the order of 8 dB. The locomotive class has subsequently been granted approval to operate in NSW.;null
briony-croft-874aa38a;10;;43rd International Congress on Noise Control Engineering, INTER.NOISE 2014;01-11-2014;The Epping to Chatswood Rail Link (ECRL) commenced operation in February 2009 with approximately 11.1 million gross tonnes of electric multiple unit rolling stock using each of the two tunnels annually. However, during acceptance testing of the ECRL an in-car noise issue was identified which required a reduction of approximately 12 dB. An acoustic rail grinding strategy was then developed and implemented. Grinding on the Sydney rail network has typically been conducted at passby speeds of 10 km/h that leave a longitudinal signature on the rail head with a wavelength of approximately 40 mm, and this in turn leads to tonal noise at approximately 450 Hz. In comparison, the ECRL grinding strategy saw higher speed grinding passbys of 25-30 km/h, with finer stones. This shifted the wavelength of the grinding signature to approximately 100-150 mm and reduced the tonal peaks in the roughness spectrum. This strategy contributed 3 to 4 dB of the overall noise reduction in a cost and time effective manner allowing the ECRL to commence revenue operations. This paper assesses the sustainability and maintainability of this acoustic grinding strategy, and compares the roughness of the freshly ground track to the roughness after approximately five and a half years of operation (shortly before the next scheduled rail grind).;http://www.acoustics.asn.au/conference_proceedings/INTERNOISE2014/papers/p438.pdf
briony-croft-874aa38a;11;;Noise and Vibration Mitigation for Rail Transportation Systems;01-01-2012;Friction between sliding surfaces decreases as the velocity of sliding increases (\u2018falling friction\u2019). This paper investigates the velocity-dependent friction relationships in non-Hertzian models of wheel-rail rolling contact. The effect of falling friction on tangential stress distribution and slip is examined. In otherwise steady rolling with constant creep, falling friction introduces a stick-slip oscillation to the trailing edge of the contact. This oscillation is increasingly unstable with increasing creep. The stick-slip behaviour at the trailing edge leads to sudden changes in the tangential stress distribution in the stick zone, including intermittent slip at the leading edge of the contact.;http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%%2F978-4-431-53927-8_5
briony-croft-874aa38a;12;2013;Vehicle System Dynamics: International Journal of Vehicle Mechanics and Mobility;01-01-2011;Models of rolling contact are used to predict the wear of the railhead due to passing wheels. It is commonly assumed in such models that material is worn away in proportion to the frictional work done in the slip zone of each contact patch. Moreover, a constant coefficient of friction is usually assumed. However, it is known that the friction coefficient between sliding surfaces decreases as the velocity of sliding increases. This paper describes a technique for including more sophisticated friction laws in a model of wheel\u2013rail rolling contact. A non-Hertzian model is used based on a variational method. The resulting tangential stress distribution and slip velocity in rolling contact are examined and compared with results calculated using a constant coefficient of friction. For conditions of rolling contact with partial slip a stick\u2013slip oscillation is found to occur when a velocity-dependent friction law is used. The pattern of material removed along the rail in rolling contact is also investigated. For low creep values and for existing broadband roughness, the inclusion of velocity-dependent friction does not result in significantly different predictions of wear. For higher creep values, velocity-dependent friction results in an unstable force\u2013friction relationship which could lead to high variable wear.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00423114.2010.543138

briony-croft-874aa38a;14;2013;Journal of Sound and Vibration;01-01-2009;"Trains generate rolling noise because of the roughness of the wheel and rail running surfaces. Special acoustic grinding programmes have been introduced on some railways specifically to control rolling noise. Rail dampers are also used to reduce rolling noise; this paper studies rail damping as a possible mechanism to slow the rate of development of roughness on the surface of rails. This would reduce noise further over time or reduce the required frequency of grinding. High roughness growth on the rail occurs in situations with stiff vertical structural dynamics of the track. In particular the antiresonance above a sleeper at the pinned\u2013pinned frequency has been identified as a wavelength fixing mechanism for short pitch corrugation. Rail dampers change the dynamic response of the rail, shifting the pinned\u2013pinned frequency and smoothing the track receptance. Here, a simple time-stepping model is applied to calculate the interaction forces between wheel and rail for a track with and without rail dampers. The calculations show that rail dampers reduce dynamic interaction forces and shift the force spectrum to longer wavelengths. The interaction forces are used as input to an abrasive wear model to predict the roughness growth rate and the change in roughness after many wheel passages. Track without rail dampers is predicted to develop corrugation at the wavelength corresponding to the pinned\u2013pinned frequency. With rail dampers the corrugation growth is reduced and shifted to a longer wavelength where its significance is diminished.";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X08009899
briony-croft-874aa38a;15;;8th International Conference on Contact Mechanics and Wear of Rail/Wheel Systems, Firenze, Italy;01-01-2009;A model of the growth rate of rail-head acoustic roughness has been developed and used to predict the effect of rail dampers on wear of the rail-head. The contact model takes account of non-Hertzian, transient contact effects and allows a velocity-dependent falling friction coefficient to be included. The wear model considers the possibility of multiple wear mechanisms arising from the non-Hertzian stress distribution in the contact patch. Both parts of the model have been simplified to two dimensions, so lateral and spin creepage are neglected. In common with some other researchers, when using a non-Hertzian contact model, no mechanism has been found for consistent roughness growth. Some combinations of initial roughness profile and different vehicle types can give increasing roughness at some wavelengths. Roughness wavelengths shorter than the length of the contact are predicted always to decrease. Rail dampers are not predicted to change significantly the rail-head roughness growth rates. Measurements taken over two years confirm that the rail dampers have little effect on roughness growth. The measurements also show that for tangent track, roughness can reduce over time particularly at short wavelengths.;null

Cellular events that are landmarks of tumorigenesis, such as loss of cell polarity and acquisition of motile properties and mesenchymal phenotype, are associated to deregulated ALK-5 signaling. ALK-5 inhibitors, such as SB505154, GW6604, SD208, and LY2157299, have recently been reported to inhibit ALK-5 autophosphorylation and induce the transcription of matrix genes. Due to their ability to impair cell migration, invasion and metastasis, ALK-5 inhibitors have been explored as worthwhile hits as anticancer agents. This work reports the development of a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) protocol aimed to prospect promising hits for further studies as novel ALK-5 inhibitors. From a lead-like subset of purchasable compounds, five molecules were identified as putative ALK-5 inhibitors.

Due to the large annual growth of cancer cases, various biological targets have been studied and related to this disorder. A very interesting target related to cancer is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In this study, we analyzed the main intermolecular interactions between a drug used in the cancer treatment (5-fluorouracil) and HER2. Molecular modeling methods were also employed to assess the molecular structure, spectroscopic properties (FTIR and UV\u2013Vis), NBO, QTAIM and HOMO-LUMO energies of 5-FU. From the docking simulations it was possible to analyze the interactions that occur between some residues in the binding site of HER2 and 5-FU. To validate the choice of basis set that was used in the NBO and QTAIM analyses, theoretical calculations were performed to obtain FT-IR and UV/Vis spectra, and the theoretical results are consistent with the experimental data, showing that the basis set chosen is suitable. For the maximum \u03bb from the theoretical calculation (254.89 nm) of UV/Vis, the electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO occurs at 4.89 eV. From NBO analyses, we observed interactions between Asp863 and 5-FU, i.e. the orbitals with high transfer of electrons are LP O15 (donor NBO) and BD* (\u03c0) N1-H10 (acceptor NBO), being that the value of this interaction is 7.72 kcal/mol. Results from QTAIM indicate one main intermolecular H bond, which is necessary to stabilize the complex formed between the ligands and the biological target. Therefore, this study allowed a careful evaluation on the main structural, spectroscopic and electronic properties involved in the interaction between 5-FU and HER2, an important biological complex related to the cancer treatment.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142517303487?via%%3Dihub

Significant correlation coefficients (CoMFA, r2 = 0.99 and q2 = 0.85; HQSAR, r2 = 0.92 and q2 = 0.72) were obtained, indicating the predictive potential of the 2D and 3D models for untested compounds. The models were then used to predict the potency of a test set, and the predicted values from the HQSAR and CoMFA models were in good agreement with the experimental results. The final QSAR models, along with the information obtained from 3D (steric and electrostatic) contour maps and 2D contribution maps, can be useful for the design of novel bioactive ligands.";https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098713001942?via%%3Dihub

The paper reviews foundational concepts and approaches from key founders of the field \u2013 Paulo Freire and Betty Reardon \u2013 before turning to two contemporary peace education scholars \u2013 Wolfgang Dietrich and Hilary Cremin \u2013 to investigate the contributions of recent scholarship toward diverse diffractive possibilities for transrational peace education. In this sense, diffraction offers pluralistic views and transformative possibilities for transrational peace education in varied contexts. Transrational peace education builds upon peace education to integrate affective and aesthetic perspectives into peace education theory and praxis. Before concluding, we offer some theoretical implications and pedagogic responses for scholars seeking to work at diffractive transrational intersections. The contribution of the paper is toward theorizing new perspectives for transrational peace education theory and praxis in the 21st century.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17400201.2019.1697065?scroll=top&needAccess=true
shawn-bryant-3bb75390;3;;Journal of Martial Arts Anthropology;01-04-2019;This paper is a reflection on  aikido  as a tool for teaching about elicitive conflict transformation and the larger field of peace and conflict studies. One of the central difficulties of teaching elicitive conflict transformation is that, as an adaptive and emergent method, it is non-prescriptive and therefore conventional didactics are inappropriate. The aim is to add to the existing corpus of literature on aikido and elicitve conflict transformation by combining the philosophical perspectives presented in this paper. The reflection builds on a comparison of Canadian First Nation\u2019s philosophy, the Japanese martial art aikido, and the Heideggerian term Verwindung  as complementary philosophical approaches  that  can  potentially  deepen  the  understanding of elicitive conflict transformation. From the starting point of the Indigenous Canadian perspective from the Hesquiaht Nation, the term wiwikink\u2019api\u2019  is introduced, which means \u2018fighting with no one.\u2019 From there, aikido is presented as both a physical and spiritual practice that teaches non-aggression and balancing forces and it is compared to Verwindung. The three philosophical approaches have notable similarities that emphasize the core principles of elicitive conflict transformation: non-dualistic perception, self-awareness, and perpetual twisting. The final remarks draw parallels between these reflections and the state of the art of elicitive conflict transformation.;http://imcjournal.com/index.php/en/volume-xix-2019/contents-number-2/1473-fighting-with-no-one-reflections-on-education-aikido-and-peace
shawn-bryant-3bb75390;4;;The International Journal of Community Diversity;01-01-2013;"While the central question of diversity has often been how to live in peace with difference, we approach the question \u2014 what happens when diversity also involves conflicting approaches to peace? This paper contains the authors\u2019 reflections on the colloquium with the same title held in the On Diversity Conference 2012 in Vancouver, where the authors and participants explored peace itself as an expression of diversity. We argue that an attempt to answer this question requires a change in focus; if there is no longer a unifying peace, how can we engage with diversity in a plurality of conflicting peaces? Mainstream peace and conflict studies literature understands conflict as opposite to peace. Supported in contemporary critical research, we argue that the concept of peace rather than being perfect, absolute and pure is in fact impure, diverse, and conflictive. Hence, an understanding of peace that attempts to embrace diversity will necessarily be relational, include conflict and engage with it, in contrast to silencing it or suppressing it. We argue that instead of being its opposite, conflict is in fact an essential component of peace. To elaborate on the argument, we deal with two of the possible interpretations of peace in history and culture: peace linked to security, understood as the eradication of threats from others and therefore recurring to ideals of perfection and homogeneity; and peace as an experience of harmony, highlighting mystical or musical harmony, which, far from being pure, emerges also out of conflicting tones. We conclude that both in traditions of mysticism and in security politics, diversities in friction lie at the core of experiencing and conceptualizing peace.Keywords: \tPlurality of Peaces, Conflict Transformation, Diversity, Security, Violence, Mysticism, HarmonyThe International Journal of Community Diversity, Volume 12, Issue 4, pp.49-60.

shawn-bryant-3bb75390;5;;The International Journal of Organizational Diversity;01-01-2013;"The dominant institutional approach to peace is that the nation-state must create peace through unity and homogeneity: one nation, one language, one law, and one national economy. The prospect of diversity implies a chaos that is abhorred, categorized, systematized, and neatly ordered. Yet this process of attempting to create peace through unity suppresses the natural forces of differentiation, and thus creates fertile ground for the escalation of conflicts. Alternatively, the prospect of unending variations seems to create the impossibility of finding any common ground. Peace, in this presentation, is relational, and as this paper assumes that the creation of value also depends on relations and agreements, it seems relevant to focus some light on the role of diversity in understandings of economics, and to question the assumptions of the discourses of economics and development. This discussion intends to suggest that through the acknowledgement of the existence of a plurality of economic systems, the possibility can be created to imagine a peace of dynamic interactions of diversity.Keywords: \tPeace, Economics, Postmodernity, Weak Pluralism, Transrational, Nation, Plurality, DevelopmentInternational Journal of Organizational Diversity, Volume 12, Issue 3, pp.31-40.

daniel-mombourquette-msc-a17a104a;2;;Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy;01-03-2018;Appendix 2 Lobster Catchability Monitoring ReportFORCE\u2019s Lobster EEMP consists of a lobster catchability study in collaboration with NEXUS Coastal Resource Management. The goal of this study is to measure whether the presence of a turbine affects the number of lobsters entering traps. Commercial lobster traps are used to compare catch volumes in different proximity to the turbine location.A catchability study was completed at the FORCE site in October - November 2017, while no turbine was deployed. This study provides baseline catchability rates in the absence of a turbine. Initial results indicate that catchability rates are high in the FORCE site, with catch rates ranging from 1.00-20.17 kg trap-1. Catch rates declined slightly during the study period, likely in relation to increasing tidal velocities. The survey design consists of two concentric rings that increase in distance from where the turbine was located in 2016-2017. Preliminary qualitative analyses indicated that there were no differences between treatment rings, or with direction from the turbine location (North, East, South, West). The next lobster catchability study will take place in October-November 2018, to coincide with the timing of the survey completed in 2017. The 2018 survey is contingent on the presence of a turbine at the site, which is needed to fully evaluate the effects of in-stream tidal turbines on lobster catchability rates.;http://fundyforce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Q3_FORCE-EEMP-Report.pdf

daniel-mombourquette-msc-a17a104a;4;;Marine Affairs Program;18-10-2013;This report details that creating a false shortage of a fishery product could potentially have several benefits. A false shortage restricts a product\u2019s abundance (supply) in the marketplace when product is not in limited supply. Based on the price-quantity theory of microeconomics, if supply of a product in the marketplace is limited then demand will consequently increase. As such, a false shortage could have the unique benefit of increasing a product\u2019s price (per unit). Another indirect benefit that could arise from creating a false shortage might be reduced harvesting pressure on the stock as catch effort decreases. Creating a false shortage in the fishery can also be explained through the theory of fisheries bioeconomics. This theory states that as effort is reduced to a specific point, costs will be reduced, thus maximizing profits (i.e. creating maximum economic yield). To further illustrate this concept, market and catch trends within a fishery will be explained using the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) fishery as an example. Within this example, market fluctuations from an \u201cactual\u201d supply shortage will be detailed. This example illustrates the possible outcomes of creating a false-shortage. Studies on the Spanish hake (merluza sp.) and Canadian silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) fisheries are used to articulate the point that when quantity (supply) is limited in healthy populations, market prices and survivorship can increase. Following this comparative analysis, a cost/benefit analysis of the predicted outcomes of creating such a false shortage is presented. Lastly, recommendations on how to promote such a management strategy are considered.;http://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/images/faculty/science/marine-affairs-program/Technical_series/Technical%%20Series_October18.pdf

anskey-miranda;1;;OMAE;17-07-2018;"This paper presents a study of the analysis methodologies used to predict the most likely response of flexibles in a subsea environment, with the aim of determining an efficient and reliable prediction methodology. The most accurate method involves simulating multiple wave realisations of a real world sea state, i.e. irregular waves, and post-processing the results to determine the most probable maximum (MPM). Due to the computationally intensive nature of this approach, however, regular wave analysis is typically used to determine flexible response. This approach considers the maximum wave within a design storm at a desired period; the choice of periods may leave room for uncertainty in the conservatism of the approach. With proper screening, regular wave analysis can be a valid yet overly conservative approach resulting in over design and additional cost. However, if screened incorrectly, there is a possibility that the choice of periods could give results that are under conservative. In addition to regular wave analysis, the paper presents two alternative methodologies to determine the most likely response, with the focus on reducing the computational resources required. The first alternative is an \u2018Irregular Wave Screen\u2019 approach in which the wave train is screened at areas of interest for waves within a user defined threshold of the maximum wave height, in addition to other user defined parameters. Only waves within these parameters are simulated to determine responses. The second alternative is the \u2018New Wave\u2019 approach, which models the most probable wave elevation around the maximum wave crest. The calculated new wave is then placed at the desired location to determine responses. The responses of the Regular, Irregular Wave Screen and New Wave methodologies are compared with the Irregular MPM approach to determine their feasibility to predict the response of flexibles in a real world irregular sea state with lower computational requirements.";null

ghyslain-gagnon-ba108012;1;;Pattern Recognition (Elsevier);01-02-2018;Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a form of weakly supervised learning where training instances are arranged in sets, called bags, and a label is provided for the entire bag. This formulation is gaining interest because it naturally fits various problems and allows to leverage weakly labeled data. Consequently, it has been used in diverse application fields such as computer vision and document classification. However, learning from bags raises important challenges that are unique to MIL. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the characteristics which define and differentiate the types of MIL problems. Until now, these problem characteristics have not been formally identified and described. As a result, the variations in performance of MIL algorithms from one data set to another are difficult to explain. In this paper, MIL problem characteristics are grouped into four broad categories: the composition of the bags, the types of data distribution, the ambiguity of instance labels, and the task to be performed. Methods specialized to address each category are reviewed. Then, the extent to which these characteristics manifest themselves in key MIL application areas are described. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art MIL methods on selected problem characteristics. This paper provides insight on how the problem characteristics affect MIL algorithms, recommendations for future benchmarking and promising avenues for research.;https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1WWKj77nKOnq1

However, in today's digital economy where data is the lifeblood of business models, managed across hybrid data environments within the constraints of complex regional regulations, data governance is no longer optional. As an organizational discipline, data governance requires buy-in from every person that works with data, and the list of roles that use data continues to grow. Getting buy-in requires changing people's mindset: rather than data governance being about controlling data access and utilization, it should be about getting the right data to the right resource at the best time, in a trustworthy manner, and for the right reasons: this is Data Enablement.

Almost half of organizations either aren\u2019t performing data audits at all, or are only performing them when issues arise. Data audits are often viewed as a time and resource drain, and organizations do not see the value in committing dedicated resources to performing them on a regular basis. Most organizations that don\u2019t perform regular data audits don\u2019t know how bad their data really is, and as a result, may end up with data security and compliance issues. Most organizations are unaware of the location of all of their data sources, and quite frequently have rogue data contained in phantom data sources that staff are using without IT\u2019s knowledge. IT is often unaware of how data is being used, and by whom, which leads to low data trust levels within the organization, and the potential for misuse of internal data.Any organization that is educated about its data assets can maximize those assets to their fullest extent. Taking a proactive approach to data auditing is something every organization needs to do. Data is one of the organization\u2019s largest assets. In order to utilize it effectively and benefit from it, data requires effective management in the form of policies, procedures, standards, and ownership.Organizations who perform audits will understand what issues exist around data quality, security, compliance, and overall data management, and what steps must be taken to create higher levels of data quality.;http://www.infotech.com/research/ss/integrate-a-data-audit-into-the-data-management-plan

stewartlbond;23;;Info-Tech Research Group;01-10-2012;Cloud solutions offer attractive benefits to business stakeholders especially around agility and cost. Moving to the Cloud involves more than outsourcing a component of the technology stack. Roles, processes, and authentication technologies need to be redefined to fit a distributed stack where parts of the IT solution space reside on-premise while the rest are in the Cloud. Cloud integration means accepting loss of control in product development. A Cloud vendor will address the needs of most constituents and any high degree of customization which counteracts their business model. This makes integration a complex initiative involving two separate parties trying to align. Cloud integration is a fundamental commitment to change within the organization as it deeply impacts roles, processes, and technologies. Be prepared to lose some degree of control of SLA management. IT will have to manage multiple Cloud SLAs and deliver a lowest common approach to the business. This may mean lowering the SLA standards previously set with on-premise solutions.

mina-ly-71175a156;1;;Ageing & Society;29-09-2020;Women's magazines are widely read in Canada. The popularity of such magazines is significant because critical gerontologists, primarily drawing on content analyses of the magazines, often argue that these publications convey problematic messages about ageing. This article broaches the subject of women's magazines and ageing from a different vantage point, that of the older woman reader herself. This audience-centred research draws on 21 semi-structured interviews with Canadian women over the age of 55. The study examines what older women say about the ageing-related content of women's magazines, along with what they say about how, when and why they read these magazines. Findings illustrate that participants are aware of the inadequate and unrealistic representations of older women in women's magazines. Nonetheless, they value the publications as a source of practical information on a variety of topics and as a light and undemanding source of entertainment and relaxation. The study reveals how participants assess and deploy magazine contents and characteristics in ways that contribute to, and are informed by, their lives and identities as older women. Against the broader cultural context of ageism, using and talking about women's magazines enables the participants to position themselves as knowledgeable and informed on a variety of topics and in multiple interactions, both in explicit reference to the magazines themselves and more generally in their lives.;https://doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X20001129

Therefore, it is crucial to conduct heterogeneous (CPU-GPU) system performance analysis in terms of power utilization. The main objective of our experimental study is to provide a detailed analysis of performance and power utilization of Convolution Neural Network for image classification of CIFAR-10 tiny images. We present an approach to calculate one convolution-layer power utilization for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems by employing CUDA and OpenCL environments. The purpose of power, performance and hardware utilization analysis is to promote green computing and to assist system designers and AI specialists in choosing a green neural network architecture for energy-aware high-performance heterogeneous systems.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9283092

jay-rao-341546a;1;;Bioresource Technology;01-11-2002;AbstractPhenols in trace quantities are usually present in the treated effluent of many wastewater-treatment plants. Phenol contamination of drinking water even at 1 microg/l concentration can cause significant taste and odor problems. This study investigates the use of non-viable pretreated cells of Aspergillus niger to remove phenol from an aqueous solution. Five types of non-viable pretreated A. niger biomass powders were used as a biosorbent to remove phenol present in an aqueous solution at a concentration of 1,000 microg/l. Sulfuric acid-treated non-viable biomass powder, which was the most effective, was used as a biosorbent in a further study. The maximum removal of phenol was observed at an initial pH of 5.1 for the sulfuric acid-treated biomass. The adsorption of phenol by pretreated A. niger biomass was best described by the Brunauer Emmet Teller model. Desorption of phenol using distilled deionized water was found to be approximately 5%% suggesting a strong biosorption by the biomass. Sulfuric acid-treated biomass beads developed through immobilization in polysulphone were used in a column study. Approximately 66%% of phenol was removed in the column operated at an initial pH of 5.1 and an initial concentration of 1,000 microg/l of phenol.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12227541

Thorough investigation revealed that SC-DHSV landing nipple sealbore damage was the root cause of failure. The failed SC-DHSVs were temporarily replaced with A-3 Storm Choke Valves.The conventional solution to restore the integrity of a failed SC-DHSV was the workover. However, efforts were made in identifying a viable rigless solution by thoroughly reviewing the available options and as an alternative, special oversized B-Type seals were chosen to substitute the existing conventional V-Type packings that failed to seal in said valves.To ensure safe field implementation, a risk assessment was conducted followed by successful yard testing. Field implementation was successfully completed by utilizing conventional slickline unit which saved significant time and cost. A standard SC-DHSV was redressed with the oversized B-Type seals, set in the landing nipple and functioned normally. The redressed SC-DHSVs were routinely tested during the following year with no concern reported. The successful implementation was documented and is recommended for future use in similar cases.;http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/app/Preview.do?paperNumber=SPE-161564-MS&societyCode=SPE
obadah-al-sawadi-96781313;2;;Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE);04-10-2010;"Non-Integral Wells are common in every aged field and managing their integrity is becoming a challenging issue, particularly in large fields and for complex dual completions such as the case in ZADCO operated fields. As part of the Well Integrity Management System (WIMS), integrity concerns are identified, investigated and subsequently mitigation measures are recommended to restore the well integrity, all in a systematic approach. Well barrier integrity is given the highest priority; therefore a comprehensive Risk Register and Risk Ranking process is implemented by ZADCO Well Integrity Team.The Risk Register process utilizes every related data and integrity investigation results to evaluate the integrity of the well primary & secondary barriers for every flow path. An individual integrity assessment is performed on the different containment sections in a well such as wellhead, inner and outer annuli and zonal isolation. Based on the severity, consequences and likelihood of a barrier failure the individual containment is given a risk rank according to ADNOC/ZADCO risk matrix. The overall risk ranking of a well reflects the highest risk rank of any of its containments. To complete the risk register, existing safeguards are addressedand appropriate short and long term mitigation actions are recommended to keep the risk at ALARP.";http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/app/Preview.do?paperNumber=SPE-137630-MS&societyCode=SPE
obadah-al-sawadi-96781313;3;;Society of Petroleum Engineers;04-10-2010;Oil producer wells which were completed with carbon steel tubular were threatened by sweet corrosion due to early water breakthrough and the presence of carbon dioxide in the associated produced gas. In severe cases corrosion led to problems which interrupted production and put the wells in an unsafe service condition. Remediation or replacement of damaged tubing was not cost effective or not feasible. A robust corrosion inhibition program through periodic squeeze treatment was implemented. Optimized and improved through the years it provided effective protection of the downhole completion and extended well operating lifetime.;http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/app/Preview.do?paperNumber=SPE-137622-MS&societyCode=SPE

The first-order regional trend is increasing methane content with depth and thermal maturity. Second-order trends are orthogonal or oblique to the first-order trend, and defined by curvilinear fairways with methane contents higher than expected from the first-order trend. They can be mapped for 10s km with some extending up-dip from the dry gas window into the oil window.;https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1c5-dyDcGMCFu

This paper presents experimental results of aging all-ceramic Si3N4-based GPs in an engine, continuing previously published results on electric and gas burner rigs. The microstructural modifications of the ceramic heater, leading to degradation and ultimately to failure, are effected by four synergistic mechanisms: electrical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal. GP lifetime in engine follows the general Arrhenius law, with activation energy of 5.2 eV, (vs 9.1 V on burner rig and 13.8 eV on electric rig, as reported previously), suggesting additional factors contributing to GP failure in the engine.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.0202724.x/full

This paper presents experimental results of the accelerated degradation tests of the GPs in air, wherein GP is heated solely by dc electricity. The complex degradation process has been linked mostly to the redistribution of the sintering additives in Si3N4/Yb2O3 system under an influence of dc electric field and temperatures over 1300\u00b0C, as experienced by GP in-service. Ytterbium ions migration varies with time, temperature, and voltage.

cwblair;4;;Combustion Theory and Modelling;23-11-2007;A predictive simulation of the autoignition process of non-premixed methane in a turbulent jet configuration was performed. Closure for the chemical source-term was obtained using Conditional Source-term Estimation with Laminar Flamelet Decomposition (CSE-LFD). The ambient oxidizer conditions \u2013 the high pressure and moderate temperatures characteristic of compression ignition engines \u2013 were chosen with the intent to validate the combustion model used under engine-relevant conditions. Validation was obtained by comparison of the predicted ignition delay to experimental results obtained from a shock-tube facility at several initial temperatures. Overall, the combination of full chemistry that has been carefully tuned to predict autoignition of premixed methane\u2013air mixtures under similar temperature/pressure conditions with the CSE-LFD model is able to successfully predict the autoignition delay time of methane\u2013air jets well within the scatter in the experimental data.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13647830701330922
cwblair;5;;University of British Columbia;01-01-2003;"Implementation of Conditional Source-term Estimation for the Prediction of Methane Ignition' The Laminar Flamelet Decomposition approach to Conditional Source-term Estimation is a recent development in combustion modeling that approximates the conditional averages of scalars as linear combinations of basis functions obtained from a library of unsteady solutions to the classical flamelet equations. Then an integral equation for a single scalar is inverted and solved for the weighting function of the basis functions. This weighting function is then used to obtain closure for the chemical source terms in the transport equations. Many parameters affect the solution of the Conditional Source-term Estimation method including the solution technique for inverting the integral equation; the number of solutions in the flamelet library; and the scalar used for the integral equation. The first part of this research investigated these parameters to optimize the solution for the Conditional Source-term Estimation. This is accomplished in the a priori sense by comparison to Direct Numerical Simulations of a simple turbulent flame. The second part of this work implemented Conditional Source-term Estimation into the commercially available multi-dimensional combustion software, KIVA-II by replacing the existing ignition mechanism. The model was used to predict the ignition of methane for different initial temperatures and compared to experimental results. The predicted ignition delay times were shorter than the experimental results but exhibited similar trends.";https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0081001

karli-ferriolo;1;;OCAD University;null;Now, more than ever, social movements are organized with increased urgency to create societies that are more equitable, just, and sustainable. Arguably, social movements cannot change societies without envisioning new future societies that are more desirable. This research explores the intersection of social movements and futures studies to understand how social movements might use strategic foresight to re-frame and transform social, economic, and environmental challenges. A critical examination of existing literature, along with a convergence map, highlights possible relationships between social movements and futures studies. A popular media scan is used to examine current climate justice movements in North America. This research contributes to a growing field of inquiry related to social movements and futures studies. It offers a new perspective on the use of strategic foresight in social movement organizing. Areas for further research include testing the ideas with social movement organizers and futures studies professionals.;http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/2837/
januszblaszczyk;1;;The 11th Symposium on Lift and Escalator Technologies, 23rd \u2013 25th September 2020, Online - University of Northampton;23-09-2020;The latest progress in Fuel Cell (FC) technologies have led to rapid developments in ground vehicle transportation. These technologies could also be considered for deployment in vertical transportation (VT) systems. This paper presents a feasibility study concerning the application of a reversible fuel cell power supply for a solar panel powered lift system operating in a high-rise building. It is assumed that all energy needed to power the elevator system will originate from the solar panels. Energy needed for operation at the low-irradiation periods will be generated from the Hydrogen stored in medium-pressure tanks. The Hydrogen will be produced in a Unitized Reversible Fuel Cell (URFC). When the Grid access is possible the grid will provide emergency power for peak operations or for longer periods of low solar panels output. The URFC unit shall operate in a tandem with a lithium-ion battery, while the size of URFC and battery shall be optimized for overall system minimum cost;http://www.liftsymposium.org
januszblaszczyk;2;;Fuel Cell Seminar & Exposition 2011, Oct.21st-Nov.3rd 2011, Orlando, Florida, USA;21-10-2011;Extended Abstract:One of the key parameters in the Fuel Cell Stack operations is the \u201cHydrogen Stoichiometry\u201d (or \u201cH2 Stoich\u201d) defined as the ratio of Hydrogen stream entering the stack to the Hydrogen stream leaving the stack. This parameter is normally used by the FC Stack manufacturer in the product specification. The Fuel Cell Integrator\u2019s task is to develop a Balance of Plant which would satisfy the stack requirements, one of which is the \u201cH2 Stoich\u201d. The verification of the \u201cH2 Stoich\u201d is important for the product warranty reasons and for trouble shooting, if stack operational problems occur during its service. Unfortunately direct measurement of this parameter is presently not possible due to the following reasons:- Gas streams in the stack inlet and outlet are mixtures of gases, not a pure Hydrogen which is specified in the stack requirements. Typically, the anode gas mix contains Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Water Vapour. There are also traces of other gases present, but their concentrations are very low.- Gas mixtures in the stack inlet and outlet contain condensing water vapour, which causes unacceptable measuring errors if traditional gas flow meters are used.A new method to determine the \u201cH2 Stoich\u201d on \u201clive\u201d (or operating) Fuel Cell Stack has been developed to remedy the situation. This method can be used both in the laboratory environment and for the FC Stacks integrated with Balance of Plant and installed in the specific applications, such as car, bus or forklift engine, or stationary power plant.;http://www.fuelcellseminar.com/media/9438/dem43b-4%%20blaszczyk.pdf

backer-kobaissi;1;;April 13, 2016;13-04-2016;This research examined the solutions available to patients affected by chronic pain, chronic disease or cancer, since a large amount of people are affected by these conditions, worldwide. The problem seems to lie in the method of administration of the medication, which is getting out of date as it burdens self-administrating patients with too many responsibilities, therefore resulting in many uncompleted treatments. By comparing the advantages and drawbacks of each method, it was determined that we are in the early stages of inventing a new technology that will revolutionize the way drugs are administered. Drug dispensing microchips are superior to the current way patients medicate, but they may require further research in the domains of biocompatibility and cost-efficiency, as those areas seem to be the ones holding back the implementation of those devices for the public. The current study aims to show that drug delivery nanotechnology is superior to oral, intravenous and subcutaneous administration methods when dealing with patients afflicted by chronic disease.;null

eliciamaine;3;;Journal of Engineering and Technology Management;01-01-2014;We investigate how the confluence of technologies can lead to radical innovation, thus creating opportunities at the firm and industry levels.  To do so, we conduct a detailed examination of the development of the transistor and of two bio-nanotechnology drugs \u2013 Doxil\u00ae and Zevalin\u00ae \u2013 from an innovation management perspective.  We argue that three innovation management strategies are central to the development of radical innovation from the confluence of technologies, namely:  importing ideas from broad networks, creating environments which allow for deep collaboration, and technology-market matching.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jengtecman.2013.10.007
eliciamaine;4;;Technovation;01-03-2012;Nanotechnology is frequently heralded as the next wave of technological advance, poised to enable radical innovation across many industries.  But as yet little is known about how firms will ultimately create that value.  We do know that nanotechnology is based on process innovation, a category of innovation less well understood than product innovation.  And we know that new ventures are an important vehicle for commercializing radical technology.  As new ventures seek to commercialize nanotechnology, they evolve value creation strategies to better link fundamental scientific advance with the creation of value for users and investors.  This paper asks \u201cHow do the successful value creation strategies of technology ventures differ in process vs. product-based innovation?\u201dAn investigation of 12 ventures representing the extremes of value creation through process-based (nanotech) and product-based (fuel cell) innovation reveals significant differences in their value creation challenges, in the mechanisms of technology-market matching and alliance building, and in their levels of experimentation.  Ventures exploiting process innovation faced greater uncertainty in their value chain positioning, market breadth, customization, and the changes required of their customers in contrast to product-based ventures. Our evidence shows that nanotechnology ventures benefit from prioritising technology-market matching, alliance building and experimenting with technologies in new value networks.Keywords:  Value Creation, Nanotechnology, Generic Technology, Radical Innovation, Process-based Innovation, Nanomaterials, Technology Commercialization,  Market for Technology, Technology Entrepreneurship, Value Networks;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497211001477
eliciamaine;5;;R&D Management;01-01-2008;Internal corporate venturing enables radical innovation within established firms in mature markets. Without effectively designed and managed internal corporate ventures, the organizationalconstraints of established firms will strongly favour incremental innovation over radical innovation. This paper investigates the evolution of a successful internal corporate venture within a large, incumbent chemical firm, now known as Evonik Degussa, to reveal the challenges, organizational design, and management strategies of their commercialization of radical nanomaterials technology.The commercialization of nanomaterials technology is of great interest to incumbent materials and chemical firms and to independent ventures, but the radical, generic, and capital intensive nature of nanomaterials technology requires organizational and managerial innovation. This case study demonstrates a model to enable growth through radical innovation in nanomaterials, while taking advantage of an incumbent firm\u2019s capabilities and complementary assets. Organizational strategies include incubation from a risk-adverse culture, relatively long timelines for evaluation, and a high-level steering committee. Managerial strategies focus on product development, risk reduction, and active risk management.;http://www.advancedmaterialscommercialization.com/Degussa%%20AdNano%%20R&D%%20Management%%20August%%202008.pdf
eliciamaine;6;;Research Policy;01-01-2006;"Generic, radical technology is of interest because of its potential for value creation across a broad range of industries and applications. Advanced materials ventures are attracted by this opportunity yet face distinctive challenges in commercializing such technology. We explore an anomaly in common assumptions about the commercialization of generic technology. We build onFreeman\u2019s concept of technological innovation as a technological and market matching process, on existing literature and on prior experience to build, inductively, a model of the variables influencing value creation by advanced materials ventures. We then test the model on the basis of detailed observation and analysis of two case studies, which have successfully created value through commercialization of advanced materials technology. Extending this theory, we offer managerial and policy recommendations to support value creation by advanced materials ventures.Keywords: Generic technology; Radical innovation;Value chain; Opportunity exploitation; Advanced materials; Technology innovation; Technology entrepreneurship";http://motresearch.bus.sfu.ca/Papers/RP_proofs_CGT_March_2006.pdf

nada-ak;1;;IEEE ICC 2021;20-04-2021;A cognitive radio (CR) network consists of wireless devices that opportunistically borrow vacant licensed bands. Cognitive users adaptively employ a perception-action decision cycle. Learning-based CR networks use past acquired knowledge of the radio environment to make smarter decisions. CR systems that use supervised learning for spectrum sensing require labeled data for training purposes. Having readily available labeled data is a complex task for CR networks, as it requires cooperation between the primary and secondary users. Such cooperation is not possible in interweave CR networks and imposes a cooperation overhead. Motivated by the above, we tackle the problem of labeled data scarcity in practical learning-based CR networks. We propose an unsupervised two-stage learning framework to perform cooperative spectrum sensing. The system combines the superior performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and low cost training data of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A system model is proposed, and the system's performance is evaluated based on the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We obtain an upper and a lower performance bounds in terms of the AUC. The detection performance is compared for the SVM, GMM, and the proposed two-stage system based on the ROC. Additionally, we evaluate the detection performance of the CR network under different primary network sizes. Our results show that the two-stage learning approach attains a higher detection performance than the GMM algorithm, and achieves the same or comparable performance to the SVM algorithm.;null
nada-ak;2;;IEEE Network;23-10-2020;Cognitive Radio (CR) technology was first introduced to solve the problem of radio spectrum under-utilization. A cognitive radio network consists of smart radio devices that have the ability to sense radio environment variables and take actions accordingly. To realize their full potential and to become fully cognitive, the CR nodes need to be equipped with learning and reasoning capabilities. Machine learning has been one of the enabling vehicles for intelligent CR networks. Inspired by the cognition cycle of a CR node, over the past years there has been an ever growing interest in using machine learning techniques to enhance the performance of CR networks. In this article, an overview of the various learning techniques currently used in the literature of CR networks is given. We focus on feature classification and clustering algorithms, and their application in cooperative CR networks. We outline the steps to establishing a learning-based cooperative secondary network, highlighting factors that impact detection performance. Additionally, current state-of-the-art learning-based applications in Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) are presented. Finally, the key challenges and future directions of intelligent cognitive networks are discussed.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9237458/
nada-ak;3;;IEEE Globecom 2020;01-01-2020;In this paper, a cooperative Secondary Network (SN) is proposed that operates under a hybrid underlay-interweave model. The narrowband sensing problem under the interweave model was formulated as a binary hypothesis problem. The Fusion Center (FC) uses learning techniques, namely the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes' (NB) to classify the state of the channel. An SVM kernel was chosen to best fit our hybrid network, since a non-linear relationship exists between the energy vectors collected at the FC. Furthermore, the degree of the polynomial SVM kernel was manipulated to minimize classification errors. The multi-class SVM (MSVM) algorithm was reformulated to fit our multiple hypothesis problem in the underlay model. The performance of the hybrid network was evaluated based on the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and classification accuracy. In addition, the accuracy of the MSVM is improved through the cooperation of the SUs. Our results show that the proposed learning-based hybrid model is robust to low SNR environments, and yields an improved performance compared with traditional cooperative sensing techniques. Moreover, we show that the Gaussian SVM kernel surpasses other proposed learning algorithms achieving as high as an 80\\%% detection rate with as low as 10%% false alarm.;null
nada-ak;4;;IEEE ETFA 2018;07-09-2018;Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology plays a critical role in maintaining road safety, avoiding accidents and controlling traffic flow. As self driving cars are expected to take over the roads, this paper discusses the intermediate phase in which manned and unmanned cars coexist. A heterogeneous network architecture that simultaneously serves manned and unmanned cars' different requirements in a suburban area is proposed and simulated using Riverbed Modeler. The feasibility of this architecture is examined in three different scenarios: Normal operation, congestion in both directions and Road Side Units (RSU) failure. In normal operation mode, traffic data is sent through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure/Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (V2I/I2V or to RSU) using IEEE 802.11p and infotainment information is communicated as V2I/I2V using Long Term Evolution (LTE). A special case is highlighted and tested, in which congestion is in both directions. In such situation, data needs to be relayed to the nearest RSU using multi-hop communication. A fault-tolerant model is also proposed and analyzed in case of failure of RSU. The performance metrics are end-to-end delay, LTE response time, handover delay and packet loss ratio. The architecture proves its suitability by satisfying traffic control real time application requirements.;https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.lib-ezproxy.concordia.ca/document/8502452

kjeld-meereboer-344195127;1;;ACS Omega;23-06-2020;Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and cellulose acetate (CA) were blended in the presence of a plasticizer, i.e., triethyl citrate (TEC), and a chain extender, i.e., poly(styrene-acrylic-co-glycidyl methacrylate). To increase the ductility and impact properties of PHBV and to investigate a new biodegradable PHBV-based blend for sustainable packaging, CA was compatibilized with TEC. PHBV and plasticized CA (pCA) blends showed complete immiscibility through separate glass transition and melting peak temperatures in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), despite the similar Hansen solubility parameters of PHBV, CA, and TEC, indicating partial miscibility. Phase separation between PHBV and pCA was clearly observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). PHBV/pCA (70:30) blends had improved impact strength, exceeding that of neat PHBV and pCA, which is attributed to PHBV porosity induced by degradation from the high processing temperature. During processing, the plasticizer migrated from CA to PHBV and partially plasticized it, as evidenced through DSC analysis. The melt temperature of PHBV was reduced, which was confirmed by double melting peaks, representing the formation of secondary crystallites at a lower temperature. Due to processing at high temperatures (210\u2013220 \u00b0C), significant porosity was observed in the PHBV/pCA 30:70 blend in SEM analysis. Consequently, the impact strength was improved by 110%% as compared to that of virgin PHBV. The addition of CE had no effect on the mechanical properties but did make the PHBV/pCA blends morphologically uniform.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.9b03369

michelle-philippe-toronto;1;;Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Repository;07-04-2020;Teachers have an important role in their student\u2019s lives (Brunzell, Waters, & Stokes, 2015). It is important that pre-service teachers are provided with knowledge and skills to best support students that may be affected by trauma or systemic inequity, and to consider problem behaviour through an informed lens. Trauma and violence-informed care (TVIC) teaching practices are universally beneficial and necessary for students healing with the after effects of trauma and structural violence. In this program evaluation, 318 teacher candidates completed an online mental health literacy course including TVIC knowledge and skills. Participants\u2019 attitudes related to trauma and their intended behavioural responses towards problem behaviour were examined before and after completion of the course. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated a positive shift in attitudes and intended behavioural responses towards a more trauma and violence-informed lens. Implications for teacher education are discussed, and future areas of research are considered.;https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9364&context=etd

Ototoxicity is induced via damage to the inner ear by reactive oxygen species. Dexamethasone reduces reactive species and has a well-documented history of transtympanic clinical use for various cochlear disorders.Objectives: Determine the effect of transtympanic dexamethasone on cisplatin ototoxicity in a guinea pig animal model.Material and Methods: Pre- and post-treatment Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) were compared to measure threshold changes in 58 guinea pigs. The optimal ototoxic dose of cisplatin, the safety of dexamethasone and the effect of dexamethasone on cisplatin ototoxicity were examined.Results: Cisplatin at a dose of 12 mg/kg induces significant hearing loss (p < 0.05) with minimal mortality. Transtympanic dexamethasone in cisplatin-treated guinea pigs showed signs of otoprotection particularly in the lower frequencies.Conclusion: Transtympanic dexamethasone presents as a simple, safe and potentially effective treatment modality against cisplatin ototoxicity.;http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=1291219909776~457&locale=en_US&show_metadata=false&VIEWER_URL=/view/action/singleViewer.do?&DELIVERY_RULE_ID=4&search_terms=Denise%%20Murphy&adjacency=N&application=DIGITOOL-3&frameId=1&useP
denise-murphy-859b5019;3;01;Acadia University Vaughan Memorial Library Archives;01-05-2007;Simultaneous multianalyte immunoassays offer advantages including reduction of technical procedures, execution time and overall cost. Protein bead array (PBA) based assays for the concurrent detection of serum antibodies to infectious agents have been reported for systemic candidiasis, Herpes viruses, measles, mumps, and HIV. These multianalyte immunoassays require small specimen volume, a critical factor for the less-invasive approaches of blood sampling such as heel or finger sticks as well as for pediatric specimens. Here, a HIV-1 protein bead array was developed for the measurement of HIV specific IgA antibodies. Four recombinant HIV-1 proteins from the gag and envelope (env) regions were covalently coupled to individual sets of microfluorospheres (Luminex Corp.). Diluted HIV+ plasma samples and HIV- control samples were assayed with coated microfluorospheres and biotinylated anti-human IgA conjugate. Different sources of anti-human IgA preparations, various sources of HIV recombinant proteins, the removal of IgG and blocking agents were analyzed for optimization of this PBA. Results for the optimization of the IgA assay include increased sensitivity upon IgG depletion and selection of a good anti-human IgA conjugate. HIV specific IgA to p24 gag protein was detected in both adult as well as pediatric plasma samples. This HIV specific PBA appeared to be a promising tool for the detection of HIV IgA. The properties inherent to this novel immunoassay are very well suited for the analysis of mucosal specimens.;http://jasper.acadiau.ca/uhtbin/cgisirsi/NNLNLzpAE4/VAUGHAN/220880022/5
denise-murphy-859b5019;4;;Amer. Soc. Grav. Space. Biol. Bull. 16(2):121-131;01-06-2003;Caves have been used in the ancient past as shelter or habitat by many organisms (including humans). Since antiquity, humans have explored caves for the minerals they contain and sometimes for ceremonial purposes. Over the past century, caves have become the target of increasing exploration, scientific research, and recreation. The use of caves on extraterrestrial bodies for human habitation has been suggested by several investigators. Lunar lava tube bases received early attention because lava tubes were clearly visible in lunar images from the Apollo Era. More recently, Mars Observer Camera data has shown us clear evidence of large tubes visible in a number of volcanic regions on Mars. The budding field of cave geomicrobiology has direct application to questions about subsurface life on other planets. Caves contain many unusual organisms making their living from unlikely materials like manganese, iron, and sulfur. This makes caves and other subsurface habitats prime targets for astrobiological missions to Mars and possibly other bodies. We present the results of a completed Phase I and on-going Phase II NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) study that intensively examines the possibilities of using extraterrestrial caves as both a resource for human explorers and as a highly promising scientific target for both robotic and future human missions to Mars and beyond.;http://mvl.mit.edu/JClub/Spr04/cave_mars.pdf

christopher-mogg-5899bb51;1;;Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology;25-11-2013;The multicomponent NADPH oxidase enzyme complex (Nox) converts molecular oxygen in a stepwise reduction to superoxides leading to the production of H2O2. This study characterized the role of the catalytic subunit (gp91phox) of Nox, NoxA and NoxB in F. graminearum. Targeted deletion of the genes NoxA and NoxB show that they differentially regulate the production of superoxides during mycelial development. The nitro blue tetrazolium staining method revealed that both the single noxA mutant and the double noxA/B mutant strains are restricted in the production of superoxides. This limitation, however, did not affect their ability to synthesize 15-ADON in culture. Deletion analyses also revealed that NoxA, but not NoxB, is involved in perithecia development and ascospore production. An in-vitro based cellophane breach assay indicated that both NoxA and NoxB contribute to virulence. The pathogenicity tests performed on a susceptible variety of wheat, \u2018Roblin\u2019, confirmed that these two genes act synergistically to promote virulence. Cumulatively, we provide evidence that the Nox homologues have non-redundant functions in F. graminearum.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07060661.2013.868370#.UrHEPvRDuus
christopher-mogg-5899bb51;2;;Biochemical Systematics and Ecology;11-01-2008;We tested extracts of Vincetoxicum rossicum for inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth and for anti-insect activities that may account for the invasive characteristics of this introduced species in North America. Bioassay-guided fractionation was used to identify (\u2013)-antofine as the principle inhibitor of bacteria and fungi in root extracts. This compound had especially pronounced antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of diverse taxa that include yeast-like and filamentous fungi and, notably, broad-host-range plant pathogens. A second compound(s), that is as yet uncharacterized but distinct from (\u2013)-antofine, was detected as having antifeedant activity against a larval hymenopteran, rose sawfly (Allantus cinctus), and toxicity to two larval lepidopterans, the masked birch caterpillar (Drepana arcuata) and the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). That V. rossicum contains potent inhibitors of plant pathogenic fungi, diverse bacteria, and herbivorous insects likely contributes to its success as an invasive species.;null

catherineclark1;1;;Journal of Aircraft;01-03-2016;The Federal Aviation Administration has worked with Transport Canada and others to develop allowance times for aircraft operating in ice-pellet precipitation based upon wind-tunnel experiments with a thin high-performance wing. These allowance times are applicable to many different airplanes. Therefore, the aim of this work is to characterize the aerodynamic behavior of the wing section in order to better understand the adverse aerodynamic effects of anti-icing fluids and ice-pellet contamination. Aerodynamic performance tests, boundary-layer surveys, and flow visualization were conducted at a Reynolds number of approximately 6.0\u00d710 66.0\u00d7106and a Mach number of 0.12. Roughness and leading-edge flow disturbances were employed to simulate the aerodynamic impact of the anti-icing fluids and contamination. In the linear portion of the lift curve, the primary aerodynamic effect is the thickening of the downstream boundary layer due to the accumulation of fluid and contamination. This causes a reduction in lift coefficient and an increase in pitching moment (nose up) due to an effective decambering of the wing. The stalling characteristics of the wing with fluid and contamination appear to be driven at least partially by the effects of a secondary wave of fluid that forms near the leading edge as the wing is rotated in the simulated takeoff profile. These results have provided a much more complete understanding of the adverse aerodynamic effects of anti-icing fluids and ice-pellet contamination on this wing.;http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.C033384
catherineclark1;2;;SAE 2015 International Conference on Icing of Aircraft, Engines, and Structures, SAE Technical Paper 2015-01-2092;01-06-2015;Simulations of supercooled large droplet (SLD) icing environments within the NRC's Altitude Icing Wind Tunnel (AIWT) have been performed in which broad band mass distribution spectra are achieved that include a distinct pattern of liquid water content (LWC) over a range of droplet sizes (i.e., bi-modal distribution). The mass distribution is achieved through modification of the existing spray system of the AIWT to allow two spray profiles with differing LWC and median volumetric diameter (MVD) to be simultaneously injected into the flow.Results of spray profile distributions measured in the test section have demonstrated that freezing drizzle conditions, where MVD is either less than or greater than 40 \u03bcm, can be achieved. Work performed to provide freezing rain conditions is also discussed and highlights the challenges of providing this environment as a result of limitations of the spray system in providing the large droplet sizes (up to 1 mm diameter) or where gravitational settling of these larger drops prevents them from reaching the test section.;http://papers.sae.org/2015-01-2092/

Wind-tunnel testing has been carried out tobetter understand the flowoff characteristics and resulting aerodynamic effects of anti-icingfluids contaminated with ice pellets using a thin, high-performance wing section at theNational Research Council of Canada Propulsion and Icing Wind Tunnel. The objective ofthis paper is to characterize the aerodynamic behavior of this wing section in order to betterunderstand the adverse aerodynamic effects of anti-icing fluids and ice-pellet contamination.Aerodynamic performance data, boundary-layer surveys and flow visualization wereconducted at a Reynolds number of approximately 6.0\u00d7106 and a Mach number of 0.12. Theclean, baseline model exhibited leading-edge stall characteristics including a leading-edgelaminar separation bubble and minimal or no separation on the trailing edge of the mainelement or flap. These results were consistent with expected 2-D aerodynamics and showedno anomalies that could adversely affect the evaluation of anti-icing fluids and ice-pelletcontamination on the wing. Tests conducted with roughness and leading-edge flowdisturbances helped to explain the aerodynamic impact of the anti-icing fluids andcontamination. The stalling characteristics of the wing section with fluid and contaminationappear to be driven at least partially by the effects of a secondary wave of fluid that formsnear the leading edge as the wing is rotated in the simulated takeoff profile. These resultshave provided a much more complete understanding of the adverse aerodynamic effects ofanti-icing fluids and ice-pellet contamination on this wing section.

These tests were a continuation of the work performed in 2010 on a generic supercritical airfoil representative of a regional-jet type aircraft wing section. Tests nominally consisted of coating the wing with de/anti-icing fluid, applying various levels of precipitation (e.g., snow, ice pellets, freezing rain, or combinations thereof), and simulating a take-off condition in the wind tunnel by accelerating the wind speed and pitching the wing through a desired pitch-profile. The wing performance was evaluated primarily by the measured lift-loss relative to the lift generated by a clean wing. The second phase of testing consisted of test cases similar to the 2010 tests in order to expand the scope of the data sets at various temperatures, while also investigating the effects of the rotation speed and ramp time on lift-loss and the effects of fluids and precipitation on stall. The experimental results were used as guidance for regulators in determining holdover and allowance times for aircraft operating in winter precipitation.;http://www.aiaa.org

cwasson;1;;Brain Research;16-12-2019;Gonadal steroid hormones affect the organization of the brain during sensitive periods of development, resulting in sex differences in the neuroendocrine function and behaviour of the offspring. Although alterations in developmental testosterone exposure have been hypothesized to play a role in male-biased neurodevelopmental disorders, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The present study investigated the hypothesis that early prenatal exposure to low concentrations of testosterone might affect the control of stress responses in later life. Pregnant CD1 mice were treated with 10\u03bcg of testosterone propionate or sesame oil control on gestational days 12, 14, and 16. Effects on development were assessed by measuring litter weight, first appearance of hair, eye and ear opening, and adult body weight. Reproductive development was assessed by measuring testosterone levels in neonatal and adult males, gonad weights in both sexes and reproductive cyclicity in females. The function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was determined by measuring corticosterone in hair samples from juvenile animals, as well as in plasma following restraint stress in adulthood. Prenatal testosterone treatment had no significant effects on any of the overall developmental or reproductive endpoints assessed. However, in adulthood, corticosterone responses to restraint stress were reduced in the male but not the female offspring, with no significant effect on basal corticosterone levels in either sex. Thus, a small prenatal increase in maternal testosterone may be sufficient to produce a lasting sex-specific alteration in the sensitivity of the male HPA axis to stress.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899319306675?via%%3Dihub

mel-wang;1;;Econometric Reviews;05-11-2015;In recent years, the suggestion of combining models as an alternative to selecting a single model from a frequentist prospective has been advanced in a number of studies. In this article, we propose a new semiparametric estimator of regression coefficients, which is in the form of a feasible generalized ridge estimator by Hoerl and Kennard (1970b Hoerl, A. E., Kennard, R. W. (1970b) but with different biasing factors. We prove that after reparameterization such that the regressors are orthogonal, the generalized ridge estimator is algebraically identical to the model average estimator. Further, the biasing factors that determine the properties of both the generalized ridge and semiparametric estimators are directly linked to the weights used in model averaging. These are interesting results for the interpretations and applications of both semiparametric and ridge estimators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these estimators based on model averaging weights can have properties superior to the well-known feasible generalized ridge estimator in a large region of the parameter space. Two empirical examples are presented.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07474938.2015.1114564

Their properties are investigated and simulation results are provided to investigate their behaviors when the error variances are small and relatively large, respectively. Thesemiparametric estimators outperform the Hoerl, Kennard and Baldwin (1975) estimator in the sense that they give less risk (total mean squared error). An empirical application is also presented.;http://www.jqe.co.in/journals/jqe_v11_15-27_huansha_wang.pdf
mel-wang;3;;Econometrics;20-09-2013;"\u201cParametric and Nonparametric Frequentist Model Selection and Model Averaging\u201d, with Aman Ullah, Econometrics, 2013, 1(2), 157-179; doi:10.3390/econometrics1020157.This paper presents recent developments in model selection and model averaging for parametric and nonparametric models. While there is extensive literature on model selection under parametric settings, we present recently developed results in the context of nonparametric models. In applications, estimation and inference are often conducted under the selected model without considering the uncertainty from the selection process. This often leads to inefficiency in results and misleading confidence intervals. Thus an alternative to model selection is model averaging where the estimated model is the weighted sum of all the submodels. This reduces model uncertainty. In recent years, there has been significant interest in model averaging and some important developments have taken place in this area. We present results for both the parametric and nonparametric cases. Some possible topics for future research are also indicated.";http://www.mdpi.com/2225-1146/1/2/157

The sensor is constructed from a glass microscope slide coated with a synthesized, polythiophene film bearing a protected, iminodiacetic acid motif. The electrode surface is then further elaborated to a functional biosensor through deprotection of the iminodiacetic acid, followed by metal-affinity immobilization of a specific and high-affinity, albumin ligand. Albumin was then quantified in buffer and synthetic urine via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Glycated albumin was next bound to a boronic acid-modified, single-cysteine dihydrofolate reductase variant to quantify glycation ratios by square-wave voltammetry. The platform offers high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility in an inexpensive arrangement. The detection limits exceed the requirements for intermediate-term glycemic control monitoring in diabetes patients at 5 and 1 nM for albumin and its glycated forms, respectively.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b16071
aisha-attar-69000396;2;;Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry;15-08-2017;Indirect competitive electrochemical immunosensor for hepatitis A virus antigen (HAV) detection was developed by immobilizing HAV on the surface of carbon nanopowder paste electrode. The monitoring of the target HAV antigen was performed using a secondary antibody labeled with peroxidase. The analytical signal corresponds to an amperometric current resulting from the addition of hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone as a redox mediator. A calibration curve was obtained by plotting the intensity of the amperometric signal versus the concentrations of HAV antigens. A low detection limit for HAV antigen was attained and estimated to be 26\u00b710\u2212 5 IU\u00b7mL\u2212 1. The sensitivity was also investigated and compared with indirect competitive ELISA. Moreover, the immunosensor provides exact results over a broad linear range from 2\u00b710\u2212 4 to 5\u00b710\u2212 3 IU\u00b7mL\u2212 1, (R2 = 0.998). The average relative standard deviation (RSD) of this method was less than 3%% for the assays performed on the same day and 7%% for the measurements made on different days. The immunosensor exhibits a good stability and high biological selectivity for HAV antigen detection and was successfully applied for the determination of HAV in water samples.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572665717304071

A high grade of Neuroblastoma is characterized by a high urinary excretion of homovanillic acid and dopamine. In this work l-leucine modified Sol-Gel-Carbon electrode was used for a sensitive voltammetric determination of homovanillic acid and dopamine in urine. The electrochemical response characteristics were investigated by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry; the modified electrode has shown an increase in the effective area of up to 40%%, a well-separated oxidation peaks and an excellent electrocatalytic activity. High sensitivity and selectivity in the linear range of 0,4\u2013100 \u03bcM L\u2212 1 of homovanillic acid and 10\u2013120 \u03bcM L\u2212 1 of dopamine were also obtained. Moreover, a sub-micromolar limit of detection of 0.1 \u03bcM for homovanillic acid and 1.0 \u03bcM for the dopamine was achieved. Indeed, high reproducibility with simple preparation and regeneration of the electrode surface made this electrode very suitable for the determination of homovanillic acid and dopamine in pharmaceutical and clinical preparations.

aisha-attar-69000396;5;2010;Electroanalysis;15-06-2016;Currently, rotaviruses (RVs) are the leading cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. This study proposes a sensitive and simple label\u2010free assay for determining rotaviruses using, for the first time, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The immunosensor is fabricated by self\u2010assembled monolayers (SAMs) of cysteamine on gold sononanoparticles (AuSNPs) modified glassy carbon electrode. The electron transfer resistance (Ret) of the electrode interface was adopted as a parameter for the detection of rotavirus. Using the proposed immunosensor, a good linear relationship (r2=0.993) between impedance change and logarithmic value of rotaviruses in a wide range of 4.6 to 4.6\u00d7104\u2005PFU\u2009mL\u22121 was found, with a low limit of detection (LOD) 2.3\u2005PFU\u2009mL\u22121 and a total analysis time of 55\u2005min. Working parameters of the immunosensor, such as pH, antibodies concentration and immune\u2010reaction time, have been investigated and optimized. No obvious interferences from non\u2010target viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV) and enterovirus were found. In addition, the electrochemical impedance immunosensor has exhibited good sensitivity, selectivity and stability.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/elan.201600179
aisha-attar-69000396;6;;International journal of environmental analytical chemistry;02-05-2016;A novel inhibition biosensor used for the detection of sulphides (Na2S) has been developed. The biosensor is based on the immobilisation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on the Sonogel-Carbon (SNGC) electrode using glutaraldehyde, Poly(4-vinylpyridine) and gold sononanoparticles (AuSNPs). The Poly(4-vinylpyridine) was used due to its high affinity for sulphide anions, while the presence of gold sononanoparticles enhances the electron transfer reaction and improves the analytical performance of the biosensor. The amperometric measurements were performed at an applied potential of \u22120.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer solution pH = 6.0. The apparent kinetic parameters (Kmapp, Vmax) of immobilised HRP were calculated in the absence of inhibitor (sulphide) using caffeic acid as substrate. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the determination of sulphide can be achieved in a dynamic range of 0.4\u20132.8 \u00b5M with a low limit of detection of 0.15 \u00b5M. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to characterise the interactions of substrate and inhibitor with the enzyme-modified electrode. The developed biosensor exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity and stability, and can be successfully applied to the detection of sulphide in water.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03067319.2016.1172216

aisha-attar-69000396;8;;Bioelectrochemistry;01-02-2015;New biosensors based on inhibition for the detection of cyanide and the comparison of the analytical performances of nine enzyme biosensor designs by using three different electrodes: Sonogel-Carbon, glassy carbon and gold electrodes were discussed. Three different horseradish peroxidase immobilization procedures with and without gold sononanoparticles were studied. The amperometric measurements were performed at an applied potential of \u2212 0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer solution pH = 5.0. The apparent kinetic parameters (Kmapp, Vmaxapp) of immobilized HRP were calculated in the absence of inhibitor (cyanide) by using caffeic acid, hydroquinone, and catechol as substrates. The presence of gold sononanoparticles enhanced the electron transfer reaction and improved the analytical performance of the biosensors. The HRP kinetic interactions reveal non-competitive binding of cyanide with an apparent inhibition constant (Ki) of 2.7 \u03bcM and I50 of 1.3 \u03bcM. The determination of cyanide can be achieved in a dynamic range of 0.1\u201358.6 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.03 \u03bcM which is lower than those reported by previous studies. Hence this biosensing methodology can be used as a new promising approach for detecting cyanide.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567539414001194

kevinpsiu;1;;University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review Vol 71(2), p 76;01-01-2013;Abstract: This paper examines the application of the principle of technological neutrality in copyright law, focusing on recent developments in Canadian jurisprudence and legislation. The principle is central to a sustainable copyright regime in an era of technological innovation. Canadian jurisprudence has largely focused on functional equivalency between physical and digital transactions in applying the principle of technological neutrality, but has not addressed how similar technologies have been treated differently in the law.  Examples from other jurisdictions show how a non-neutral regime can lead to economic inefficiencies and hinder innovation. This paper argues that the best way to protect the integrity of copyright law and promote technological development is to enhance the principle of technological neutrality through a paradigm shift from a list of enumerated statutory rights to a general right to commercially exploit copyrighted works.;null

Through an analysis of the involvement of women in the workforce, strikes, and political organizations, it contends that a parallel narrative of female involvement in the Lakehead\u2019s labouring history exists between 1903 and 1918. During this period, women were involved in advocating for, and giving a voice to, both themselves and their sex in a largely male dominated area, and era of influence.;null

baconk2;1;;The AMS 40th Conference on broadcast meteorology;01-08-2012;This paper explores the theoretical model of Media Induced Severe Storm Anxiety (MISSA). The MISSA model hypothesizes that as heavy media users are increasingly exposed to television weather news, the more likely they will suffer from MISSA. Academic research shows that local television stations can create fear messages with the intentions of keeping audiences captive as a method of increasing ratings, and generating revenue for the broadcast station. The existence of MISSA as a media theory was established through the application of Herman and Chomsky's media propaganda model, George Gerbner's cultivation theory, and mean world syndrome to the literature of media fear messaging, television weather news, and severe weather phobia. This paper asks the following research questions: Does local weather newscasts contain the fear-driven messages required to cause MISSA? Does the audience perceive these messages as intended by the local station? Can cultivation theory be addressed within MISSA? The paper concludes by proposing a four-step methodological approach combining focus groups, content analysis, in-depth interviews, and quantitative surveys, as a means of testing MISSA's application to the field of metrological journalism.;https://ams.confex.com/ams/40BROADCAST/webprogram/Paper208432.html
baconk2;2;;FRESH peer-reviewed symposium, McMaster University;01-04-2012;The theory of linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity proposes that language and linguistic norms largely impact and shape thought. The popular television show Dexter is a language-driven program with a heavy emphasis on the thoughts of the main character, Dexter. This article discusses the presence of linguistic relativism in Dexter. Using content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis, the following research questions are addressed: (RQ1) does the language that is used to describe Dexter shape his reality? (RQ2) does Dexter privilege the language of some characters over others? (RQ3) is there a change in how language is used over the course of the five seasons of Dexter? (RQ4) does this change affect the way Dexter shapes his reality? The research findings suggest that Dexter's reality is indeed shaped by language, and thus Dexter is a show that promotes linguistic relativism to a wide audience. This article recommends future directions for research in the field of linguistic determinism theory and contemporary media.;null

Unlike other major cities in Canada, Hamilton\u2019s local print media seems to thrive, despite a national trend which suggests more people are reading national news. For example, The Hamilton Spectator\u2019s daily print edition reaches over 335,500 Hamiltonians a week (The Hamilton Spectator, 2009). However, when it comes to political results, how powerful is Hamilton\u2019s print news media at determining municipal outcomes? Are the forces of priming at work in the Hamilton\u2019s print news media? How does the local print media influence outcomes?Our team conducted a research study suing content analysis to analyze all newspaper articles relating to the mayoral race in Hamilton during the 2010 municipal election. We surveyed 64 articles from September 10th, 2010 to October 25, 2010, which resulted in a corpus of 40,147 words.The study found a negative correlation of .95 of the total mentions to the number of votes received by the top three mayoral candidates (Fred Eisenberger, Larry Di Ianni and Bob Bratina). The study also uncovered the possibility of a structural bias in the journalistic coverage of the election, as one journalist wrote the majority of the articles studied. However, this had no bearing on the informativity, tonality, and cognitive reference value of the articles as our results showed an overwhelming tendency towards neutrality.;null
gregsomers;1;;University of Ottawa;01-01-2016;Block-structured matrices arise in several contexts in circuitsimulation problems. These matrices typically inherit the pattern ofsparsity from the circuit connectivity. However, they are alsocharacterized by dense spots or blocks. Direct factorization of thosematrices has emerged as an attractive approach if the host memory is sufficiently large to store the block-structured matrix. The approach proposed in this thesis aims to accelerate the direct factorization of general block-structured matrices by leveraging the power of multiple OpenCL accelerators such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).The proposed approach utilizes the notion of a Directed Acyclic Graph representing the matrix in order to schedule its factorization on multiple accelerators. This thesis also describes memory management techniques that enable handling large matrices while minimizing the amount of memory transfer over the PCIe bus between the host CPU and the attached devices. The results demonstrate that by using two GPUs the proposed approach can achieve a nearly optimal speedup when compared to asingle GPU platform.;https://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/35128
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;1;;Nature Communications;27-08-2018;Pericytes are mural cells that surround capillaries and control angiogenesis and capillary barrier function. During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial cell-derived platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) regulates pericyte proliferation and migration via the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2). PDGF-B overexpression has been associated with proliferative retinopathy, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that abnormal, \u03b1-SMA-expressing pericytes cover angiogenic sprouts and pathological neovascular tufts (NVTs) in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Genetic lineage tracing demonstrates that pericytes acquire \u03b1-SMA expression during NVT formation. Pericyte depletion through inducible endothelial-specific knockout of Pdgf-b decreases NVT formation and impairs revascularization. Inactivation of the NCK1 and NCK2 adaptor proteins inhibits pericyte migration by preventing PDGF-B-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2 at Y1009 and PAK activation. Loss of Nck1 and Nck2 in mural cells prevents NVT formation and vascular leakage and promotes revascularization, suggesting PDGFR\u03b2-Y1009/NCK signaling as a potential target for the treatment of retinopathies.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;2;;Science;10-08-2018;"Excess dietary lipid uptake causes obesity, a major global health problem. Enterocyte-absorbed lipids are packaged into chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream through intestinal lymphatic vessels called lacteals. Here, we show that preventing lacteal chylomicron uptake by inducible endothelial genetic deletion of Neuropilin1 (Nrp1) and Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (Vegfr1; also known as Flt1) renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Absence of NRP1 and FLT1 receptors increased VEGF-A bioavailability and signaling through VEGFR2, inducing lacteal junction zippering and chylomicron malabsorption. Restoring permeable lacteal junctions by VEGFR2 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin signaling inhibition rescued chylomicron transport in the mutant mice. Zippering of lacteal junctions by disassembly of cytoskeletal VE-cadherin anchors prevented chylomicron uptake in wild-type mice. These data suggest that lacteal junctions may be targets for preventing dietary fat uptake.";null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;3;04-02;Circulation;05-07-2018;Background -Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited vascular disorder that causes arterial-venous malformations (AVMs). Mutations in the genes encoding Endoglin (ENG) and Activin-receptor-like kinase 1 (AVCRL1 encoding ALK1) cause HHT type 1 and 2, respectively. Mutations in the SMAD4 gene are present in families with Juvenile Polyposis/HHT syndrome that involves AVMs. SMAD4 is a downstream effector of Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2)/Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family ligands that signal via Activin like kinase receptors (ALKs). Ligand-neutralizing antibodies or inducible, endothelial-specific Alk1 deletion induce AVMs in mouse models as a result of increased PI3K/AKT signaling. Here we addressed if SMAD4 was required for BMP9-ALK1 effects on PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Methods -We generated a tamoxifen-inducible, postnatal endothelial-specific Smad4 mutant mice (Smad4i\u0394EC). Results -We found that loss of endothelial Smad4 resulted in AVM formation and lethality. AVMs formed in regions with high blood flow in developing retinas and other tissues. Mechanistically, BMP9 signaling antagonized flow-induced AKT activation in an ALK1 and SMAD4 dependent manner. Smad4i\u0394EC endothelial cells in AVMs displayed increased PI3K/AKT signaling, and pharmacological PI3K inhibitors or endothelial Akt1 deletion both rescued AVM formation in Smad4i\u0394EC mice. BMP9-induced SMAD4 inhibited Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) transcription, in turn limiting PTEN phosphorylation and AKT activation. Consequently, CK2 inhibition prevented AVM formation in Smad4i\u0394EC mice. Conclusions -Our study reveals SMAD4 as an essential effector of BMP9-10/ALK1 signaling that affects AVM pathogenesis via regulation of CK2 expression and PI3K/AKT1 activation.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;4;;Nature;11-05-2017;Blood and lymphatic vasculatures are intimately involved in tissue oxygenation and fluid homeostasis maintenance. Assembly of these vascular networks involves sprouting, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Recent studies have suggested that changes in cellular metabolism are important to these processes. Although much is known about vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent regulation of vascular development and metabolism, little is understood about the role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in this context. Here we identify FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling as a critical regulator of vascular development. This is achieved by FGF-dependent control of c-MYC (MYC) expression that, in turn, regulates expression of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2). A decrease in HK2 levels in the absence of FGF signalling inputs results in decreased glycolysis, leading to impaired endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Pan-endothelial- and lymphatic-specific Hk2 knockouts phenocopy blood and/or lymphatic vascular defects seen in Fgfr1/Fgfr3 double mutant mice, while HK2 overexpression partly rescues the defects caused by suppression of FGF signalling. Thus, FGF-dependent regulation of endothelial glycolysis is a pivotal process in developmental and adult vascular growth and development.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;5;03;Nature Communications;29-11-2016;Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial serine-threonine kinase receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Inactivating mutations in the ALK1 gene cause hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disabling disease characterized by excessive angiogenesis with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Here we show that inducible, endothelial-specific homozygous Alk1 inactivation and BMP9/10 ligand blockade both lead to AVM formation in postnatal retinal vessels and internal organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in mice. VEGF and PI3K/AKT signalling are increased on Alk1 deletion and BMP9/10 ligand blockade. Genetic deletion of the signal-transducing Vegfr2 receptor prevents excessive angiogenesis but does not fully revert AVM formation. In contrast, pharmacological PI3K inhibition efficiently prevents AVM formation and reverts established AVMs. Thus, Alk1 deletion leads to increased endothelial PI3K pathway activation that may be a novel target for the treatment of vascular lesions in HHT2.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;6;04;Nature Communications;24-11-2016;Vascular permeability and neovascularization are implicated in many diseases including retinopathies and diabetic wound healing. Robo4 is an endothelial-specific transmembrane receptor that stabilizes the vasculature, as shown in Robo4-/- mice that develop hyperpermeability, but how Robo4 signals remained unclear. Here we show that Robo4 deletion enhances permeability and revascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and accelerates cutaneous wound healing. To determine Robo4 signalling pathways, we generated transgenic mice expressing a truncated Robo4 lacking the cytoplasmic domain (Robo4\u0394CD). Robo4\u0394CD expression is sufficient to prevent permeability, and inhibits OIR revascularization and wound healing in Robo4-/- mice. Mechanistically, Robo4 does not affect Slit2 signalling, but Robo4 and Robo4\u0394CD counteract Vegfr2-Y949 (Y951 in human VEGFR2) phosphorylation by signalling through the endothelial UNC5B receptor. We conclude that Robo4 inhibits angiogenesis and vessel permeability independently of its cytoplasmic domain, while activating VEGFR2-Y951 via ROBO4 inhibition might accelerate tissue revascularization in retinopathy of prematurity and in diabetic patients.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;7;;Journal of Cell Biology;26-09-2016;"Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.";null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;8;04-03;Cancer Research;09-09-2016;The CXCL4 paralog CXCL4L1 is a less studied chemokine that has been suggested to exert an antiangiogenic function. However, CXCL4L1 is also expressed in patient tumors, tumor cell lines, and murine xenografts, prompting a more detailed analysis of its role in cancer pathogenesis. We used genetic and antibody-based approaches to attenuate CXCL4L1 in models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Mechanisms of expression were assessed in cell coculture experiments, murine, and avian xenotransplants, including through an evaluation of CpG methylation and mutation of critical CpG residues. CXCL4L1 gene expression was increased greatly in primary and metastatic PDAC. We found that myofibroblasts triggered cues in the tumor microenvironment, which led to induction of CXCL4L1 in tumor cells. CXCL4L1 expression was also controlled by epigenetic modifications at critical CpG islands, which were mapped. CXCL4L1 inhibited angiogenesis but also affected tumor development more directly, depending on the tumor cell type. In vivo administration of an mAb against CXCL4L1 demonstrated a blockade in the growth of tumors positive for CXCR3, a critical receptor for CXCL4 ligands. Our findings define a protumorigenic role in PDAC development for endogenous CXCL4L1, which is independent of its antiangiogenic function.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;9;;Circulation Research;27-06-2016;RATIONALE:Arterial endothelial cells are morphologically, functionally and molecularly distinct from those found in veins and lymphatic vessels. How arterial fate is acquired during development and maintained in adult vessels is incompletely understood.OBJECTIVE:We set out to identify factors that promote arterial endothelial cell fate in vivo.METHODS AND RESULTS:We developed a functional assay allowing us to monitor and manipulate arterial fate in vivo, using arteries isolated from quails that are grafted into the coelom of chick embryos. Endothelial cells migrate out from the grafted artery and their colonization of host arteries and/or veins is quantified. Here we show that sympathetic innervation promotes arterial endothelial cell fate in vivo. Removal of sympathetic nerves decreases arterial fate and leads to colonization of veins, while exposure to sympathetic nerves or norepinephrine imposes arterial fate. Mechanistically, sympathetic nerves increase endothelial ERK activity via adrenergic \u03b11 and \u03b12 receptors.CONCLUSIONS:These findings show that sympathetic innervation promotes arterial endothelial fate and may lead to novel approaches to improve arterialization in human disease.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;10;;Science signaling;03-05-2016;Angiogenesis is induced by various conditions, including hypoxia. Although cap-dependent translation is globally inhibited during ischemia, the mRNAs encoding two important proangiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), are translated at early time points in ischemic muscle. The translation of these mRNAs can occur through internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), rather than through cap-dependent translation. Hypoxic conditions also induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading us to assess the interplay between hypoxia, ER stress, and IRES-mediated translation of FGF-2 and VEGF We found that unlike cap-dependent translation, translation through FGF-2 and VEGF IRESs was efficient in cells and transgenic mice subjected to ER stress-inducing stimuli. We identified PERK, a kinase that is activated by ER stress, as the driver of VEGF and FGF-2 IRES-mediated translation in cells and in mice expressing IRES-driven reporter genes and exposed to hypoxic stress. These results demonstrate the role of IRES-dependent translation in the induction of the proangiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2 in response to acute hypoxic stress. Furthermore, the PERK pathway could be a viable pharmacological target to improve physiological responses to ischemic situations.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;11;;Circulation;26-01-2016;BACKGROUND:Sprouting angiogenesis is a key process driving blood vessel growth in ischemic tissues and an important drug target in a number of diseases, including wet macular degeneration and wound healing. Endothelial cells forming the sprout must develop front-rear polarity to allow sprout extension. The adaptor proteins Nck1 and 2 are known regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and polarity, but their function in angiogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the Nck adaptors are required for endothelial cell front-rear polarity and migration downstream of the angiogenic growth factors VEGF-A and Slit2.METHODS AND RESULTS:Mice carrying inducible, endothelial-specific Nck1/2 deletions fail to develop front-rear polarized vessel sprouts and exhibit severe angiogenesis defects in the postnatal retina and during embryonic development. Inactivation of NCK1 and 2 inhibits polarity by preventing Cdc42 and Pak2 activation by VEGF-A and Slit2. Mechanistically, NCK binding to ROBO1 is required for both Slit2- and VEGF-induced front-rear polarity. Selective inhibition of polarized endothelial cell migration by targeting Nck1/2 prevents hypersprouting induced by Notch or Bmp signaling inhibition, and pathological ocular neovascularization and wound healing, as well.CONCLUSIONS:These data reveal a novel signal integration mechanism involving NCK1/2, ROBO1/2, and VEGFR2 that controls endothelial cell front-rear polarity during sprouting angiogenesis.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;12;01-03-01;Oncotarget;22-09-2015;IRE1\u03b1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane signaling protein and a cellular stress sensor. The protein harbors a cytosolic dual kinase/endoribonuclease activity required for adaptive responses to micro-environmental changes. In an orthotopic xenograft model of human glioma, invalidation of IRE1\u03b1 RNase or/and kinase activities generated tumors with remarkably distinct phenotypes. Contrasting with the extensive angiogenesis observed in tumors derived from control cells, the double kinase/RNase invalidation reprogrammed mesenchymal differentiation of cancer cells and produced avascular and infiltrative glioblastomas with blood vessel co-option. In comparison, selective invalidation of IRE1\u03b1 RNase did not compromise tumor angiogenesis but still elicited invasive features and vessel co-option. In vitro, IRE1\u03b1 RNase deficient cells were also endowed with a higher ability to migrate. Constitutive activation of both enzymes led to wild-type-like lesions. The presence of IRE1\u03b1, but not its RNase activity, is therefore required for glioblastoma neovascularization, whereas invasion results only from RNase inhibition. In this model, two key mechanisms of tumor progression and cancer cell survival are functionally linked to IRE1\u03b1.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;13;01-05-01;Nature Communications;17-06-2015;Sprouting angiogenesis drives blood vessel growth in healthy and diseased tissues. Vegf and Dll4/Notch signalling cooperate in a negative feedback loop that specifies endothelial tip and stalk cells to ensure adequate vessel branching and function. Current concepts posit that endothelial cells default to the tip-cell phenotype when Notch is inactive. Here we identify instead that the stalk-cell phenotype needs to be actively repressed to allow tip-cell formation. We show this is a key endothelial function of neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), which suppresses the stalk-cell phenotype by limiting Smad2/3 activation through Alk1 and Alk5. Notch downregulates Nrp1, thus relieving the inhibition of Alk1 and Alk5, thereby driving stalk-cell behaviour. Conceptually, our work shows that the heterogeneity between neighbouring endothelial cells established by the lateral feedback loop of Dll4/Notch utilizes Nrp1 levels as the pivot, which in turn establishes differential responsiveness to TGF-\u03b2/BMP signalling.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;14;02-01-02;Nature Medicine;21-05-2015;Ocular neovascular diseases are a leading cause of blindness. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade improves vision, but not all individuals respond to anti-VEGF treatment, making additional means to prevent neovascularization necessary. Slit-family proteins (Slits) are ligands of Roundabout (Robo) receptors that repel developing axons in the nervous system. Robo1 expression is altered in ocular neovascular diseases, and previous in vitro studies have reported both pro- and anti-angiogenic effects of Slits. However, genetic evidence supporting a role for Slits in ocular neovascularization is lacking. Here we generated conditional knockout mice deficient in various Slit and Robo proteins and found that Slit2 potently and selectively promoted angiogenesis via Robo1 and Robo2 in mouse postnatal retina and in a model of ocular neovascular disease. Mechanistically, Slit2 acting through Robo1 and Robo2 promoted the migration of endothelial cells. These receptors are required for both Slit2- and VEGF-induced Rac1 activation and lamellipodia formation. Thus, Slit2 blockade could potentially be used therapeutically to inhibit angiogenesis in individuals with ocular neovascular disease.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;15;;RNA Biol;01-01-2015;The activation of translation contributes to malignant transformation and is an emerging target for cancer therapies. RNA G-quadruplex structures are general inhibitors of cap-dependent mRNA translation and were recently shown to be targeted for oncoprotein translational activation. In contrast however, the G-quadruplex within the 5'UTR of the human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) has been shown to be essential for IRES-mediated translation. Since VEGF has a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis and is a major target of anti-tumoral therapies, we investigated the structure/function relationship of the VEGF G-quadruplex and defined whether it could have a therapeutic potential. We found that the G-quadruplex within the VEGF IRES is dispensable for cap-independent function and activation in stress conditions. However, stabilization of the VEGF G-quadruplex by increasing the G-stretches length or by replacing it with the one of NRAS results in strong inhibition of IRES-mediated translation of VEGF. We also demonstrate that G-quadruplex ligands stabilize the VEGF G-quadruplex and inhibit cap-independent translation in vitro. Importantly, the amount of human VEGF mRNA associated with polysomes decreases in the presence of a highly selective stabilizing G-quadruplex ligand, resulting in reduced VEGF protein expression. Together, our results uncover the existence of functionally silent G-quadruplex structures that are susceptible to conversion into efficient repressors of cap-independent mRNA translation. These findings have implications for the in vivo applications of G-quadruplex-targeting compounds and for anti-angiogenic therapies.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;16;01;Circulation;09-09-2014;BACKGROUND:Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) signaling is a control point that determines the extent of vascular tree formation. Recent studies demonstrated an important role played by VEGFR2 endothelial trafficking in control of its activity and suggested the involvement of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1b (PTP1b) in this process. This study was designed to define the role of PTP1b in endothelial VEGFR2 signaling and its role in regulation of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis.METHODS AND RESULTS:We generated mice carrying an endothelial-specific deletion of PTP1b and examined the effect of this knockout on VEGF signaling, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis in vitro and in vivo. PTP1b knockout endothelial cells had increased VEGF-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, sprouting, migration, and proliferation compared with controls. Endothelial PTP1b null mice had increased retinal and Matrigel implant angiogenesis and accelerated wound healing, pointing to enhanced angiogenesis. Increased arteriogenesis was demonstrated by observations of faster recovery of arterial blood flow and large numbers of newly formed arterioles in the hindlimb ischemia mouse model. PTP1b endothelial knockout also rescued impaired blood flow recovery after common femoral artery ligation in synectin null mice.CONCLUSIONS:PTP1b is a key regulator of endothelial VEGFR2 signaling and plays an important role in regulation of the extent of vascular tree formation.;null
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;17;;J Clin Invest;01-11-2013;"Aberrant blood vessel formation contributes to a wide variety of pathologies, and factors that regulate angiogenesis are attractive therapeutic targets. Endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like protein (ESDN) is a neuropilin-related transmembrane protein expressed in ECs; however, its potential effect on VEGF responses remains undefined. Here, we generated global and EC-specific Esdn knockout mice and demonstrated that ESDN promotes VEGF-induced human and murine EC proliferation and migration. Deletion of Esdn in the mouse interfered with adult and developmental angiogenesis, and knockdown of the Esdn homolog (dcbld2) in zebrafish impaired normal vascular development. Loss of ESDN in ECs blunted VEGF responses in vivo and attenuated VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 signaling without altering VEGF receptor or neuropilin expression. Finally, we found that ESDN associates with VEGFR-2 and regulates its complex formation with negative regulators of VEGF signaling, protein tyrosine phosphatases PTP1B and TC-PTP, and VE-cadherin. These findings establish ESDN as a regulator of VEGF responses in ECs that acts through a mechanism distinct from neuropilins. As such, ESDN may serve as a therapeutic target for angiogenesis regulation.";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24177422

CXCL4L1 x-ray structure is determined, and it reveals a previously unrecognized chemokine structure adopting a novel C-terminal helix conformation.

alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;19;03-02-02;FASEB J;27-02-2013;"Glycosphingolipids, which are abundant at the surface of melanoma cells, play crucial roles in tumor progression. We investigated whether a newly described glycosphingolipid hydrolase, encoded by the GBA2 gene, can modulate human melanoma cell growth and death. GBA2 expression was quantified on melanoma cells by RT-qPCR. The antiproliferative effects of GBA2 were assessed in tumor cells expressing inducible GBA2 and in established melanoma xenografts. As a control an inducible catalytically inactive GBA2 mutant was generated. Sphingolipid levels were monitored by mass spectrometry; unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis were assessed by Western blot and flow cytometry analyses, respectively. We report that GBA2 is down-regulated in melanoma; inducible expression of GBA2 affects endogenous sphingolipid metabolism by promoting glucosylceramide degradation (decrease by 78%%) and ceramide generation; this is followed by a UPR that causes apoptosis, subsequent decreased anchorage-independent cell growth, and reduced in vivo tumor growth (by 40%%); and all these events are abrogated when expressing a catalytically inactive GBA2. This study documents for the first time the antitumor activity of GBA2 and provides evidence for the role of nonlysosomal glucosylceramide breakdown as a source of bioactive ceramide and a mechanistic link between glycolipid catabolism and the UPR/death response of melanoma cells.";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23073830
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;20;01;Circulation Research;02-03-2012;Cardiac tissue cohesion relying on highly ordered cardiomyocytes (CM) interactions is critical because most cardiomyopathies are associated with tissue remodeling and architecture alterations. Eph/ephrin system constitutes a ubiquitous system coordinating cellular communications which recently emerged as a major regulator in adult organs. Ephrin-B1 is necessary for cardiac tissue architecture cohesion by stabilizing the adult CM morphology through regulation of its lateral membrane. Because decreased ephrin-B1 is associated with molecular/functional cardiac defects, it could represent a new actor in the transition toward heart failure.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302788
alexandre-dubrac-74aab070;21;02;Blood;25-11-2010;CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 are 2 closely related CXC chemokines that exhibit potent antiangiogenic activity. Because interactions with glycosaminoglycans play a crucial role in chemokines activity, we determined the binding parameters of CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 for heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate B. We further demonstrated that the Leu67/His67 substitution is critical for the decrease in glycan binding of CXCL4L1 but also for the increase of its angiostatic activities. Using a set of mutants, we show that glycan affinity and angiostatic properties are not completely related. These data are reinforced using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes structural modifications in CXCL4L1 due to the presence of His67 and that blocks its biologic activity. In vivo, half-life and diffusibility of CXCL4L1 compared with CXCL4 is strongly increased. As opposed to CXCL4L1, CXCL4 is preferentially retained at its site of expression. These findings establish that, despite small differences in the primary structure, CXCL4L1 is highly distinct from CXCL4. These observations are not only of great significance for the antiangiogenic activity of CXCL4L1 and for its potential use in clinical development but also for other biologic processes such as inflammation, thrombosis or tissue repair.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20688960

pulkit7;1;03;IEEE EXPLORE;25-06-2018;(Topics- Data Mining, Natural Language Processing)(Paper ID: P1588)The aim of the paper is to extract and compare the behavioral units of Bengalese Finch and White-Rumped Munia's songs and represent them by a scanner which is a counter automaton of sub-regular language. Scanner allows us to recognize the bird songs at a fast rate. We have used ethological data mining and automata-based approach for finding the rules governing the structure of bird songs. We have demonstrated the difference in the results obtained for both the birds. The results indicate that it is possible to represent these songs by using 3-factor strictly local language(Youtube link - https://youtu.be/Fz7nhg7y5GY );https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8393131/
pulkit7;2;;BeTR-RL;null;Adversarial methods for imitation learning have been shown to perform well on various control tasks. However, they require a large number of environment interactions for convergence. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end differentiable adversarial imitation learning algorithm in a Dyna-like framework for switching between model-based planning and model-free learning from expert data. Our results on both discrete and continuous environments show that our approach of using model-based planning along with model-free learning converges to an optimal policy with fewer number of environment interactions in comparison to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods.;http://www.betr-rl.ml/2020/abs/43/

fouadfaraj;2;;Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration;16-04-2021;Within the natural resource industries, there is an increasing amount of data and number of variables being recorded when sampling a site. This has made multivariate geospatial datasets more difficult to analyze, in particular the definition of estimation or simulation domains used in geostatistical analysis. Establishing these domains is typically the first step for any subsequent geostatistical workflows or modeling. Domains are traditionally established using categorical data such as lithology, mineralization, or alteration from geological logging and are aimed at identifying distinct populations with particular geological, spatial, and statistical features. The manual logging process is time-consuming and costly but is required because defining geologically homogenous volumes is crucial for the planning, extraction, and processing of natural resources. Classical clustering methods have aided in analyzing the multivariate datasets, but the resulting clusters from these methods do not correlate well with geological logging and do not allow practitioners to input their knowledge of the domain in the clustering process. In this work, a simple unsupervised classification workflow is presented which allows the practitioner to input domain knowledge by selecting relevant variables to cluster reasonable geological domains. This can be used as a tool to aid the manual logging procedure or as a tool to establish domains for different uses such as defining zones with different rock hardness distributions which allows the corresponding volumes to be sent to appropriate mills for efficient mineral processing. The performance of the workflow is assessed on a mining dataset using the geochemical information and validated with the geological logging.;https://rdcu.be/ciQlU
fouadfaraj;3;;Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Multi-Domain Operations Applications III;12-04-2021;The next generation of multi-domain airborne platforms will provide military operators with unparalleled sensor data streams spanning video, radar, and other sensor inputs. These expanded sensor capabilities will substantially increase access to critical, near-real time surveillance. However, the process of interpreting video feeds places a significant burden on intelligence operators, a demand that can be addressed by AI-based algorithms. AI-based tools complement the aerial footage processing tasks performed by full motion video analysts. In this work, we introduce a new aerial pattern of life dataset and describe our latest algorithmic developments, which uses deep learning to gain an understanding of a scene\u2019s patterns of life. This approach allows anomalies, outliers from standard patterns of life, to be identified using supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Herein, we describe our deep learning models and our corresponding microservices software architecture. The patterns of life and anomaly detection performance is measured through analysis of video from this new remotely piloted aerial system (RPAS) flight campaign dataset.;https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2584816

fouadfaraj;5;;Earth Science Reviews;01-01-2020;The morphological study of geological hand samples has a wide variety of applications in the geosciences, which is conventionally accomplished by measuring the distance between features of interest on the sample's surface. Close-range three-dimensional (3D) laser scanners provide an opportunity to study the form and shape of geological samples in a digital environment and have been increasingly utilized in fields such as paleontology, rock mechanics, and sedimentology, with some uptake in planetary sciences and structural geology. For paleontological studies, primary applications are in quantitative analysis of fossil morphology and integration into 3D animated models for understanding species movements. In the field of rock mechanics, typical uses of 3D digital geological hand sample models include quantifying joint roughness coefficient (JRC), determining the surface roughness of rock samples, and assessing morphological changes over time due to processes such as weathering. In the field of sedimentology, such models are incorporated to characterize the shape of sediment particles and to calculate key parameters such as bulk density. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of established literature that includes substantial use of digital geological hand samples acquired from 3D close-range (<1\u202fm target distance) triangulation laser scanners in an effort to identify opportunities for future progress (such as global data sharing) as well as challenges specific to the nature of geological samples (e.g., translucency) and geoscientific workflows (on and off-site).;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825220303676?dgcid=coauthor

In 2012, ConocoPhillips drilled two wells in the field that gave us significant insight into the drilling mechanics of slim hole horizontal wells.  After 6 consecutive motor failures in the lateral of the first well in 2012, the decision was made to take steps to understand what was happening down hole.  The paper will cover the findings as they relate to understanding and mitigating some of the common drilling dysfunctions in the field including vibration, buckling, and loss of WOB while rotating.This paper will provide some tools and ideas to identify and mitigate some drilling dysfunctions that cause drilling inefficiencies in fields all around the world.During the planning phase it was determined that the field had a history of drilling dysfunctions.  Of these dysfunctions, buckling was identified and addressed in the planning phase.  Vibration problems were confirmed while drilling, and steps were taken to mitigate the vibrations.  Significant loss of WOB (over 20klbs) while rotating without buckling was observed, and steps were taken to compensate for this loss. Data will be presented to dispute the industry assumption that a well is axially \""frictionless?? while rotating; significant drag can in some cases exist in a well even while in rotary drilling mode.  An alternate theory to relate axial friction to RPM will be presented.Various drilling dysfunctions are often common in the field, and often viewed as acceptable since the industry is still able to drill the wells.  Dealing with the downhole dysfunctions our industry face will likely improve our drilling performance.  The current theory on axial friction of rotating drill pipe is proven incorrect, which means a new mathematical model is needed for the torque and drag computer models.";https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-166155-MS

lexiewing;1;;Journal of Youth and Adolescence;25-04-2019;"Developmental theory on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; e.g., self-cutting without lethal intent) underscores that stressful life experiences may lead to heightened risk for NSSI, potentially by undermining individuals\u2019 emotion coping capacities. Given that the transition to university is often accompanied by new stressors for emerging adults, it is possible that stressors experienced during the university years may lead to heightened susceptibility for NSSI during this developmental period. Cross-sectional research supports a positive association between stressful experiences and NSSI among students; however, longitudinal research is needed to examine the direction of effects and explore potential mediating factors (i.e., emotion dysregulation). In the present study, university students (N\u2009=\u20091132; 70.5%% female; mage\u2009=\u200919.11) reported on their stressful experiences in university, difficulties in emotion regulation, and NSSI each year for three consecutive years. Path analysis revealed a bidirectional association between stressful experiences and NSSI. Increased stressful experiences predicted increased risk for NSSI through emotion dysregulation, and NSSI predicted increased stressful experiences through emotion dysregulation. Overall, these findings provide new insight into the processes through which NSSI may be initiated and maintained, as well as elucidate the impacts of NSSI on emotion regulation and stressful life experiences in university.";https://rdcu.be/bzD0P

johanathan;2;;KOTESOL Proceedings;01-01-2008;Current research into varieties of English represents a paradigm shift in how English is perceived in the global community. The advent of the term, Global English has been closely argued by proponents and opponents. Opponents, according to Graddol (1997), claim that English is a tool of imperialism and examines the hegemonic nature of English and its close ties with the reduced linguistic diversity in the world. This is especially critical in Asia where more than 30%% of the world\u2019s living languages reside and it is one of the fastest consumers of English as a foreign and second language. However, the proponents look at English as both a tool of empowerment and an emblem of unification in the globalizing world. Butler (2002: 166) points out that while there are other languages with as many speakers or more, none offers the \u201csame dual passport, legitimacy at the local level as well as the international level.\u201d More important than the debate on the usefulness of Global English is the need for a paradigm shift in language planning where English sustains rather than destroys the multilingual ethos of Asia and the rest of the world. The paradigm should not be one dominating Global English which homogenizes and corrupts cultures, but an international language that encourages the speakers from various domains to incorporate their L1 norms and values, and to use English as International Language (EIL) for local as well as international interaction and communication.;null
johanathan;3;;KOTESOL Proceedings;01-01-2008;Compared to other teaching fields, disputes and ambiguities regarding the knowledge base and competence required for an English language teacher (ELT) is striking due not only to the broad terms defining the teachers\u2019 proficiency in teaching but also their status as a native speaker (NS) or as a nonnative speaker (NNS). There is little dispute that teachers should have a postsecondary education and possess strong knowledge of English, but beyond this, there are disagreements on what makes a good ELT. Furthermore, when teaching English, a distinction must be made between EFL and ESL. EFL indicates the use of English in a non-English-speaking region while ESL is the use of English within an English speaking region for generally refugees, immigrants and their children.According to Zheng\u2019s description (cited in Jie 1999: para 6), the following items may be taken into consideration for the evaluation of a teacher of second language: teaching effectiveness, linguistic competency, presentation of foreign culture, and classroom management skills. In the scope of this paper, the categories of linguistic competency (English), confidence of language usage, students\u2019 perception of the teachers\u2019 competency and the classroom management based on psychological elements and personality will be examined.Students of English prefer NSs because of their perceived superiority in fluent, idiomatic spoken English and pronunciation (Ellis 2002). Given the fact that 80%% of all ESL/EFL teachers worldwide are NNS of English (Liu 1999), the diverse geographical and linguistic backgrounds of these teachers must be examined in terms of the criteria of a good teacher (Canagarajah 1999). Although the terms NNS and NS are useful for classification, the differentiating among teachers based on their status as native or nonnative speakers perpetuates the dominance of the NS in the ELT profession, contributes to discrimination in hiring practices and relegates NNSs to the second class status.;null

melissa-pullara-ph-d-319b8267;1;;Civilizations of the Supernatural, edited by Fabrizio Conti. Trivent Publishing, 2020. Pp. 313-336.;01-11-2020;In this chapter, I argue that the Weird Sisters in Macbeth influence him to pursue rational deliberation, a key facet of humanist moral philosophy, wherein people make decisions that serve an individual good rather than a universal morality. I conduct a literary analysis of the play to demonstrate how Shakespeare parallels the witches and Macbeth by highlighting their linguistic similarities and shared propensity for rhetorical, and by extension, psychological manipulation through rationalization. In so doing, Shakespeare reveals that the potential for the abuse of reason towards individual gain is an innate part of a flawed human nature which people, particularly those who make up larger religious and political institutions, seek to deny by displacing that internal threat onto external forces in an attempt to ignore their own moral fallibilities. I end the chapter with a brief look at Thomas Middleton\u2019s The Witch and Ben Jonson\u2019s Masque of Queens to demonstrate how other early modern English playwrights complicate the relationship between witch and human characters to demonstrate how closely related the two are.;null

Au Qu\u00e9bec, le pourcentage de femmes en m\u00e9decine est pass\u00e9 de 10,2%% en 1976 (Dedobbeleer et al., 1980) \u00e0 plus de 50%% en 2018 (Coll\u00e8ge des M\u00e9decins, 2018); celui de femmes dentistes de 20%% en 1999 (O\u2019Keefe, 2001) \u00e0 47,1%% en 2017 (Ordre des dentistes du Qu\u00e9bec, 2017); et celui de pharmaciennes de 40%% en 1987 (Collin, 1992) \u00e0 62,2%% en 2018 (Ordre des pharmaciens du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018). Cette hausse du nombre de femmes invite \u00e0 remettre en question les effets de leur pr\u00e9sence accrue dans ces professions. Quelles sont les transformations dans l\u2019organisation du travail qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engendr\u00e9es par cette augmentation? Est-ce que des changements sont aussi observables dans la culture organisationnelle? Les enjeux genr\u00e9s li\u00e9s \u00e0 la carri\u00e8re pour les femmes dans le milieu de la sant\u00e9 ainsi que la f\u00e9minisation de certaines professions historiquement masculines ont attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention des chercheuses et chercheurs de diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9gions du monde. Des recherches men\u00e9es notamment en Europe, aux \u00c9tats-Unis et au Canada montrent diff\u00e9rents constats (Goldin et Katz, 2016; Pastor et al., 2012; Rajeh et al., 2014). La plupart d\u2019entre elles mettent de l\u2019avant que malgr\u00e9 une int\u00e9gration importante, voire une pr\u00e9sence d\u00e9sormais majoritaire des femmes dans ces professions, force est de constater que les construits genr\u00e9s, ainsi que les rapports in\u00e9galitaires qui en d\u00e9coulent, influencent les cultures professionnelles et les parcours individuels des femmes dans ces professions. Les r\u00e9sultats de notre recherche s\u2019inscrivent en coh\u00e9rence avec celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 men\u00e9es ailleurs, tout en portant un regard sp\u00e9cifique sur la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des m\u00e9decins, des dentistes et des pharmaciennes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises.";https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/2492820

The aim of the model is to provide brain-computer interfaces with improved cursor control without the need for a separate eye tracking device. To test the accuracy of the model \""in-the-wild,\"" an EEG dataset with (uncontrolled) natural saccades was used, where subjects looked freely at images on a screen. EEG data was input to deep neural networks, namely a multi-layer perceptron and a convolutional neural network. As benchmarks, two systems were explored using features measured from the Fp1/2 EEG channels, as well as from the AF7/8, F7/8, FT7/8, and T7/8 channels. Experimental results show the proposed system achieving an accuracy of 72.92%%, thus outperforming all benchmarks, which achieved accuracies of 51.80%% and 50.72%%, respectively.";null
anastasiospapachristou;1;;Neural Computing and Applications;04-05-2020;Accurate indoor air temperature (IAT) predictions for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are challenging, especially for multi-zone building and for different HVAC system types. Moreover, the nonlinearity of the buildings thermal dynamics makes the IAT prediction more difficult since it is affected by complex factors such as controlled and uncontrolled points, outside weather conditions and occupancy schedule. This paper presents a long shortterm memory (LSTM) model to predict IAT for multi-zone building based on direct multi-step prediction with sequenceto-sequence approach. Two strategies, LSTM-MISO and LSTM-MIMO, are built for multi-input single-output and multiinput multi-output, respectively. The performance of these two strategies has been evaluated based on two case studies on real smart buildings using variable air volume (VAV) and constant air volume (CAV) systems. For both buildings, experimental results showed that the LSTM models outperform multilayer perceptron models by reducing the prediction error by 50%%.;https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00521-020-04926-3?sharing_token=7NW_dFtADoUIKQjAIIVK0_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY68ay2fDMaTodGjQBPfCccjnn9RXYg2Fdkbs_51DhL_oA8wXjbqtXRxC-LQ8v4g7bwA3dbYdEsjWD9N8gUmXll4Kjy1gTedcPlsTv9HoT7fpvSBE6ZFYMigXDiElwgmMSZTx1wi8zpV0Ts
anastasiospapachristou;2;;IEEE;10-10-2018;Distribution networks are three-phase systems supplying electricity to loads. While, ideally, the load at each point of the network would be equally distributed among the three phases, this is not the case in practice. The three-phase voltages and currents are thus unbalanced due to the different magnitudes of loads at each phase. The integration of single-phase distributed generation (DG), e.g., photovoltaic (PV) units installed at secondary networks, adds more challenges to the voltage unbalance in distribution networks. This paper investigates through simulations the impact of DG on the voltage unbalance in Canadian benchmark rural distribution networks. The maximum penetration levels of DG that can be integrated into distribution networks are determined taking into consideration the standard limits of voltage unbalance, operating voltage limits, and thermal ratings of the feeder. Different configurations of voltage regulators and DG are studied. Simulation results showed that the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) decreases with the integration of three-phase DG especially when high penetration levels of DG are located close to the end of the main feeder. Up to 24 MW of three-phase DG can be connected to the main feeder, which is 154%% of the total peak load, without violating any of the limits. It was also found that the maximum size of a single-phase DG can be at least 3 times the peak load of a given node at any single-phase lateral.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8598420&isnumber=8598278
anastasiospapachristou;3;;Science and Technology for the Built Environment;15-03-2018;The current article presents a numerical and experimental study of predictive control strategies based on a low-order model in a test cell that emulates a perimeter zone of a building. The test cell uses a phase change material as a means of thermal storage. The phase change material, embedded in the wall of the test cell furthest away from the window, is thermally actively charged through forced air circulation. The objective of the study is to investigate how model-based predictive control can be used to optimize the performance of a phase change material wall. The present article also shows how a low-order thermal network model can be used as an effective tool in the design and implementation of the model-based predictive control strategy. The proposed model predictive control algorithm uses a set of linear ramp functions to change the room temperature set-point to reduce and shift peak power demand. These ramp set-point profiles allow the effective charging and discharging of the wall-integrated phase change material. The algorithm applied in the experimental facility uses the outdoor temperature as an input to select the best charging and discharging rates over a prediction horizon. A low-order model of the room and the phase change material wall is used in the predictive control algorithm. It was found that this model can accurately predict the peak power demand (coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square error 28.2%% and normalized mean bias error 3.4%%) and the room temperature profile. As the process moves forward in time, the weather profile is updated periodically and the algorithm calculates the new outputs over the new control horizon. The whole procedure is automated and the outputs of the algorithm are transferred to the test room controller through BACnet.;https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/MkHpEtv8ciu7SYb2pGth/full
anastasiospapachristou;4;;IBPSA - eSIM 2016 Conference Proceedings;06-05-2016;This paper presents a simulation study of predictive control strategies to reduce and shift peak load in a zone of a perimeter office with floor heating, convective cooling and various floor configurations while maintaining acceptable comfort conditions. A case study is considered where a building automation system controls the floor heating, convective cooling and shades. For the specific case study considered, the window-to-wall ratio is 75%%, resulting in high solar gains. These solar gains are useful in winter but in summer they need to be reduced by controlling the shades to reduce total cooling load. The simulations results show that an exposed concrete floor (no carpet) can lead to significantly lower peak (about 40%% in cooling and 45%% in heating) in the auxiliary heating/cooling as compared to a carpeted floor.;http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/eSimPapers/2016/34-90-eSim2016.pdf

jabir-mohamed;1;;Epilepsy Research;01-12-2018;Patients with focal temporal lobe seizures often experience transient episodes of impaired awareness with behavioral arrest, but the precise mechanism remains unknown. The Network Inhibition Hypothesis attributes these deficits to a loss of cholinergic input to the cortex. This is presumed to result from increased activation of inhibitory regions that suppress subcortical arousal, giving rise to cortical delta wave activity. Recently, this hypothesis has been tested in animal experiments, where triggering dorsal hippocampal seizures is associated with behavioral arrest. To further test this hypothesis in animals \u2013 and, more specifically, to characterize the relationship between propagated discharge, cortical delta waves and behavioral arrest \u2013 we performed partial kindling studies in three different limbic sites in rats. We found that seizure discharge took longer to spread from the amygdala than the hippocampus, and took more stimulations to elicit behavioral arrest. In addition, the onset of propagated discharge in subcortical and cortical sites did not always match with the onset of behavioral arrest. Importantly, the activity seen in the cortex did not resemble the slow waves seen in deep sleep. Together, these findings suggest that limbic discharge triggers epileptic discharge in downstream pacemakers, including the cortex, and that these secondarily cause behavioral arrest.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920121118303139?via%%3Dihub
jabir-mohamed;2;;Journal of Neuroscience;24-08-2016;"Seizures that impair consciousness and cardiorespiratory function have a significant, negative impact on patient safety and quality of life. If uncontrolled, such seizures can limit a patient's driving ability, productivity at school and work, or worse, lead to death (Blumenfeld, 2012). Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most devastating consequence of refractory epilepsy, but the precise mechanism remains unknown. Nonetheless, evidence suggests a combination of cardiorespiratory compromise and decreased arousal (Massey et al., 2014). Therefore, understanding how seizures cause loss of consciousness and cardiac or respiratory arrest is essential. Progress on this front has been aided by two hypotheses (Richerson and Buchanan, 2011; Blumenfeld, 2012), which attribute these deficits to different neuromodulators, specifically acetylcholine and serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)].";http://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/34/8777

marco-ho-95794b15a;1;;International Journal of Pharmaceutics;30-08-2020;Bacteriophage-encoded endolysins (lysins) have emerged as a novel class of antibacterial agents to combat the surging antibiotic resistance. Lysins have specific structures and mechanisms to exert antibacterial effect against both Gram-positive (G+ve) and Gram-negative (G-ve) bacteria. However, its use against G-ve bacteria is limited because the outer membrane (OM) of G-ve bacteria hinders the permeation of exogenously applied lysins. Besides identifying lysins with intrinsic OM permeability, several other approaches including combining lysins with outer membrane permeabilizers (OMPs), protein engineering and formulating with nanocarriers have been proposed to enhance the permeability and activity of lysins. In the present review, we summarize strategies that have been developed to enable lysins to target G-ve bacteria in the past decade. While lysins demonstrates clear potential in managing bacterial infections caused by the drug-resistant G-ve bacteria, there are still challenges hindering their translation into clinical settings, including safety issues with OMP use, low efficiency against stationary phase bacteria and problems in stability. The applicability of protein engineering and formulation sciences to improve enzyme stability, and combination therapy with other classes of antibacterial agents to maximize the therapeutic potential have also been reviewed.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378517320308188?via%%3Dihub

ian-sewell-m-sc-1a7688a0;1;2019;Ian Sewell;01-03-2018;Triploid oysters can be created through chemical or pressure treatments that induce a diploid embryo to become a triploid by blocking the expulsion of a polar body during development. Triploid oysters are desirable because they are sterile, faster growing, and have more energy to fight pathogens. Little is known about triploid induction in the Eastern oyster using hydrostatic pressure. The focus of these experiments were to evaluate different variables to elucidate their impact on triploid induction and assess the growth of triploid Eastern oysters grown in Canadian waters. The first objective of this study was to determine the most efficient pressure intensity and duration treatments that would yield the highest triploidy induction rates in the Eastern oyster. The second objective was to compare the growth of triploid vs diploid oysters in field conditions in the Bras d\u2019Or lake, Nova Scotia.;http://hdl.handle.net/10222/73859

kevinpraymond;1;;Journal of Controlled Release;10-12-2012;The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has raised the possibility of using engineered nanoparticles that interact within biological environments for treatment of diseases. Nanoparticles interacting with cells and the extracellular environment can trigger a sequence of biological effects. These effects largely depend on the dynamic physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, which determine the biocompatibility and efficacy of the intended outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms behind these different outcomes will allow prediction of the relationship between nanostructures and their interactions with the biological milieu. At present, almost no standard biocompatibility evaluation criteria have been established, in particular for nanoparticles used in drug delivery systems. Therefore, an appropriate safety guideline of nanoparticles on human health with assessable endpoints is needed. In this review, we discuss the data existing in the literature regarding biocompatibility of nanoparticles for drug delivery applications. We also review the various types of nanoparticles used in drug delivery systems while addressing new challenges and research directions. Presenting the aforementioned information will aid in getting one step closer to formulating compatibility criteria for biological systems under exposure to different nanoparticles.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365912008553
kevinpraymond;2;;Lab on a Chip;28-05-2012;We present a colourimetric litmus test for simple differentiation of organic liquids based on wetting, which achieves chemical specificity without a significant sacrifice in portability or ease- of-use. Chemical specificity is derived from the combination of colourimetric wetting patterns produced by liquids in an array of inverse opal films, each having a graded wettability, but using different surface groups to define that gradient.;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/LC/C2LC40489c
kevinpraymond;3;;ACS Nano;20-12-2011;Colorimetric litmus tests such as pH paper have enjoyed wide commercial success due to their inexpensive production and exceptional ease of use. Expansion of colorimetry to new sensing paradigms is challenging because macroscopic color changes are seldom coupled to arbitrary differences in the physical/chemical properties of a system. Here we present the design of a \u201cWetting In Color Kit\u201d (WICK), an inexpensive and highly selective colorimetric indicator for organic liquids that exploits chemically encoded inverse-opal photonic crystals to project minute differences in liquids' wettability to macroscopically distinct, easy-to-visualize structural color patterns. We show experimentally and corroborate with theoretical modeling using percolation theory that the highly symmetric structure of our large-area, defect-free SiO2 inverse-opal films leads to sharply defined threshold wettability for liquid infiltration, occurring at intrinsic contact angles near 20deg with an estimated resolution smaller than 5deg. The regular structure also produces a bright irridescent color, which disappears when infiltrated with liquid, coupling the optical and fluidic responses. To design a WICK that differentiates a broad range of liquids, we introduced a nondestructive quality control procedure to regulate the pore structure and developed two new surface modification protocols, both requiring only silanization and selective oxidation. The resulting tunable, built-in chemistry gradients let us tailor the wettability threshold to specific liquids across a continuous range. With patterned oxidation as a final step, we control the shape of the liquid- specific patterns displayed, making WICK easier to read. Using these techniques, we demonstrate the applicability of WICKs in several exemplary systems. As wetting is a generic fluidic phenomenon, we envision that WICK could be suitable for applications in authentication or identification of unknown liquids across a broad range of industries.;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn204220c

cwawrinchuk;1;03;Remtech 2015;15-10-2015;Most contaminated sites in Alberta are covered by glacial deposits and encompass complex geology and hydrogeology. An effective 3D hydrogeological conceptual model, combined with other tools like groundwater 3D numerical modeling, can be used to define, more precisely, the location and fate of contaminants coming from and moving within these glacial deposits and into lower geological units. Additionally, these models can assist in further assessing the movement of contaminant plumes through different hydrogeological units.With the current advances in the software technology and the availability of more advanced equipment, a well-supported 3D geological model is a valuable tool in the development of more accurate conceptual hydrogeological models. This is particularly useful in complex sites where many years of information exist but is poorly understood. Starting with the initial design of a 3D geological model which incorporates site hydrogeology and contaminant concentration distributions, a comprehensive 3D conceptual site model can be achieved. With this comprehensive conceptual site model, the movement of contaminant plumes can be well defined and an effective remediation strategy can be implemented at the site.An integrated 3D approach can be applied to contaminated sites throughout Alberta thereby improving the characterization and understanding of these sites and allowing for more efficient remediation strategies.;http://www.esaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15-Jaimes.pdf

A stack of 127 slices, were acquired from RM of the right knee. The segmentation of the region of interest was performed on 3D Slicer, using the Single Region Growing. The final geometry was created in Comsol Multiphysics through the measure obtained by segmentation. To optimize the model\u2019s elaboration, we performed only the region of interest: the flow, the artery walls and the muscles soleus, medial gastrocnemius, plantaris and popliteus. CFD and FSI were performed using the commercial software Comsol Multiphysics 5.0 (COMSOL, Inc., Stockholm, Sweden). In CFD section, in agreement with the experimental data, the popliteal blood velocity varied from 30[cm/s] to 70 [cm/s]. In FSI phase, the entrapment due to the gastrocnemius muscle caused a maximum displacement of the popliteal artery walls of 0.16 [mm]. When the entrapment is due to soleus muscle, the maximum displacement of the artery is about 0.3947 [mm]. The most important observation is the variation of contact pressure in two cases of entrapment. In fact, when the occlusion is due to soleus muscle, the pressure is higher than the precedent case. The CFD model and the FSI model resulted in a detailed description of fluid dynamic and fluid-structure interactions useful to evaluate the pathology\u2019s features, independently, from the obstacles of in vivo analysis. These models can define the sites more solicited where there is the most probability to have an aneurysm.;null

fcondemi;9;;61th Annual Conference of ASAIO;01-01-2015;We are developing a new paired membrane umbrella double lumen cannula (DLC) to support failing Fontan patients. The objectives of this computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study were to evaluate the performance/flow pattern and the potential for blood thrombosis of the paired umbrella DLC.The paired umbrella DLC is inserted from the right jugular vein and superior vena cava (SVC) into the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). Blood is withdrawn from the SVC and the inferior vena cava (IVC) through the drainage lumen and reinfused into the pulmonary artery (PA)via the infusion lumen. A realistic 3D geometry of the paired umbrella DLC and an idealized 3D geometry of the TCPC were constructed. The two paired membrane umbrellas were positioned at a distance of 8\u2009cm from each other, and the infusion outlet was designed 4\u2009cm above the PAanastomosis . CFD was performed at 2\u20135 l/min flow rates. The laminar flow model was used for Reynolds number (Re) less than 4000. The shear-stress transport (SST) k-\u03c9 turbulent model was implemented for Re greater than 4000. Blood was assumed to be a Newtonian fluid. The finitevolume method was used for governing equations discretization.This CFD study predicted that our paired membrane umbrella DLC can perfuse both the right and left PA, eliminating the strict alignment requirement and guaranteeing adequate performance. However, blood stagnancy, which may increase thrombosis risk, was found close to the two paired membrane umbrellas for all flow rates (2\u20135 l/min). The stagnant blood flow volume (for a velocity <1\u2009mm/s) decreased from 1.48 mm^3 at 2 l/min to 0.04 mm^3 at 5 l/min.The paired membrane umbrella DLC perfused both the right and left PA, ensuring adequate performance. Although blood stagnancy was found, the volume was very small (<1 mm3). Long-term studies will be necessary to determine thrombosis risk.;null

This  protocol  has  been validated  on 30  healthy  subjects and tested  on 25 patients with Rotator cuff Syndrome documented by shouder\u2019s clinical tests or echography.The aim of this work is to determine for which movement there are the most relevant restrictions on examinated patients.For  the  movement  analysis  we have used an optoelectronic  digital  system(BTS SMART-DX)consists of two of infrared cameras directly connected to an integration  box  that  contains  appropriate  software  for  data  capture and motion analysis.The protocol used 8 markers positioned on anatomical points of subject\u2019s shoulder.It has been possible to analyze the shoulder\u2019s movements limitations caused by Rotator cuff Syndrome.The most sensitive movements,compared to the normal  class  ones, are and  humerus  abduction  (95.83\u00b0\u00b120.04)and  flexion (133,27\u00b0\u00b112.56), extra-rotation (58.77\u00b0\u00b119.33) and intra-rotation (69,47\u00b0\u00b0\u00b117,98)  while  the less  sensitive  movements  are  scapula  rotation during abduction and flexion (42,73\u00b0\u00b11%% and 48,63\u00b0\u00b111%%).Next step is to use this protocol to follow how this angles change during the time in these patients after different medical or Phisicaltherapy .;null

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance, flow pattern, blood hemolysis, and thrombosis potential of the pRVAD DLC.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), using the finite volume method, was performed on the pRVAD DLC. For Reynolds numbers <4000, the laminar model was used to describe the blood flow behavior, while shear-stress transport k-\u03c9 model was used for Reynolds numbers >4000. Bench testing with a 27 Fr prototype was performed to validate the CFD calculations.There was <1.3%% difference between the CFD and experimental pressure drop results. The Lagrangian approach revealed a low index of hemolysis (0.012%% in drainage lumen and 0.0073%% in infusion lumen) at 5 l/min flow rate. Blood stagnancy and recirculation regions were found in the CFD analysis, indicating a potential risk for thrombosis.The pRVAD DLC can handle up to 5 l/min flow with limited potential hemolysis. Further modification of the pRVAD DLC is needed to address blood stagnancy and recirculation.;null

However, doubts still exist about the perfusion of the epiaortic vessels after apicoaortic conduit implantation, especially when severe aortic stenosis is associated with aortic valve insufficiency. The aim of the study was to evaluate the perfusion of the epiaortic vessels (innominate artery, left carodit artery and left subclavian artery) in cases of mixed aortic valve disease before and after apicoaortic conduit implantation.Starting from the data of a real patient with severe aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency who underwent apicoaortic conduit implantation, we created a computational model where severe aortic valve stenosis was associated with different grades of aortic insufficiency (mild, medium and moderate).A total of six combinations were analysed. In all simulations, the more severe the concomitant aortic insufficiency, the more the flow through the epiaortic vessels was diminished. After apicoaortic conduit implantation, there was an absolute augmentation of the median output in each epiaortic vessel compared with the same combination of mixed aortic valve disease before implantation. Interestingly, retrograde flow from the conduit in the descending aorta was minimal and did not contribute to the improved output of the epiaortic vessels.The computational analysis suggested a protective effect, rather than steal phenomenon, of the apicoaortic conduit towards the cerebral perfusion, even in cases of mixed aortic valve disease.;null

annapriu;6;;2th CMI Conference on Cybersecurity and Privacy (CMI);28-11-2019;Ubiquitous mobile technology like Smart Connected Toys (SCTs) have unique challenges of clearly defining context data elements due to unstructured, consistent, and persistent changes in the environment. SCTs interact with its context to achieve meaningful functionality while maintaining context data privacy. As SCTs become increasingly pervasive, the toys with their built-in features must be aware of and adapt to their changing contexts while providing a sense of privacy and security to contextual data processed to support its use. This paper presents a context profile through SCT Privacy-Preserving Context Ontology (PPCO) and examines the benefits of designing a context data model for SCT privacy goals. Our proposed data context model is an abstract model, which organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another. It organizes properties of related entries in SCT based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to depict and project how the SCT contextual information - related to the SCTs' environment - is assembled and maintained. Ultimately, the PPCO provides a structured description of the SCT context profile necessary to identify needed privacy controls to support SCT privacy goals.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8962141

Hybrid play systems are complex design artefacts since they use real and virtual information, so they present new challenges to both designers and developers. We suppose both industries could benefit with hybrid design approaches from product concepts. Our main research goal aims to develop tools and methods to assist the community in developing such interactions. Hence, we performed a systematic literature review covering related research published between 2008 and 2016. To extend our contribution, we added 120 hybrid play products from a market review. After data extraction, we managed results to propose a relational model for hybrid gameplay interaction.

hua-song-1324439;1;2013-05-2013;ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces;27-05-2020;The effects of Zn\u2013Pt interaction and Pt dispersion over a uniform compact cylindrical shape ZSM-5 (UZSM-5) on the catalytic octane aromatization performance are investigated. The comparison between different Pt- and Zn-modified ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrates the significance of ZSM-5 morphology and, more importantly, the metal distributions on it. For the UZSM-5 support, Pt atoms prefer to occupy the sites within its inner pores, resulting in high selectivity to xylenes during the octane aromatization. The Zn deposit in inner pores and higher dispersion of Pt lead to the spillover of Pt sites to the external surface, which is critical for the activation of octane to produce reaction intermediates that are further converted to aromatics over the inner pore catalytic sites. These effects are evidenced by a diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy study of CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface. In situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectra are collected to probe the coordination number and the chemical environment of Pt and Zn atoms in the catalysts during the octane aromatization reaction. Pt and Zn are well dispersed and stable during the reaction, and a partial reduction of Pt during the reaction is observed. A theoretical study using the density functional theory method predicts that the reaction and transition-state intermediates upon octane activation are better stabilized by Pt(111) of Pt external surface sites with a smaller activation barrier, indicating their significance in C\u2013H activation. This hypothesis is further evidenced by comparing the octane aromatization performance of various modified catalysts through varying Zn loading, blocking inner pores, and covering the external catalytic sites with SiO2.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c07039

hua-song-1324439;5;;Fuel;31-01-2020;The direct conversion of bamboo to aromatics was investigated over Zn and/or Ga modified zeolite catalysts under a methane environment. Aromatics are the main liquid products from bamboo conversion on a batch reactor. The reaction over Zn-Ga/ZSM5(30) gives 19.2 wt%% yield of aromatics with 55.6%% selectivity towards BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) at 400 \u00b0C. Zn loading promotes the deoxygenation of oxygenated intermediates from bamboo decomposition and favors the formation of BTEX. Ga addition has little effect on BTEX selectivity but improves the aromatics yield. The presence of methane has a negligible impact on residue reduction, however, methane co-existence could benefit the formation of aromatics. Acidity characterization using pyridine and ammonia as probes shows HZSM5 modification with Zn and Ga species significantly increase the number of weak acidic sites. The catalyst with abundant acidic sites, particularly, weak acidic sites, would be beneficial for the conversion of bamboo to aromatics with higher BTEX selectivity. More aromatics with less residue can be produced from bamboo with higher holocellulose content. The results reported in this work could contribute to a better understanding of bamboo conversion into valuable chemicals and cost-efficient utilization of biomass resources.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236120301915?dgcid=author
hua-song-1324439;6;;Fuel;12-09-2019;The effects of variable factors such as temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), catalyst regeneration and reaction time on catalytic upgrading of heavy oil under methane environment over Ag-Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst are evaluated by small pilot plant tests. The viscosity, TAN and average molecular weight of the heavy oil samples are notably reduced accompanied with a low olefin content after the catalytic upgrading. Methane incorporation to product molecules results in increased liquid product yield. The simulated distillation and compositional analysis results illustrate the conversion of resin and asphaltene components to small molecules. After the upgrading at 430\u202f\u00b0C and 5\u202fMPa, the percentage of gasoline content is increased to 17%% from 3%% in the feedstock, and the percentage of diesel fraction is increased to 27%% from 21%%. The percentage of light end volatiles is increased from 4.4%% to 22.2%%. During the catalytic upgrading, a higher temperature and pressure benefits the oil quality improvement and methane participation while maintaining the high liquid yield and low coke generating rate. Outstanding stability of the product oil samples is witnessed by comparing the products obtained at variable reaction time. A higher WHSV results in slightly compromised performance of the catalytic upgrading of heavy oil under methane. A positive effect of catalyst regeneration is witnessed. Stable oil quality from the upgrading process is observed when catalysts have been regenerated twice or more. The knowledge obtained in this study would benefit the potential industrial application of this innovative technology at larger scales and guide the further reaction condition optimization.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236119315157?via%%3Dihub
hua-song-1324439;7;;Fuel;23-05-2019;One-pot catalytic co-conversion of xylose and methane to aromatics was investigated under solvent-free conditions. Aromatics are the major liquid products from xylose conversion. 57.6%% yield of aromatics with 63.1%% selectivity of BTEX, and 10.9%% yield of solid residue are achieved over HZSM-5 modified with Zn and Cr species. It\u2019s evidenced that methane presence could effectively improve the yield of aromatics and the selectivity of BTEX, and greatly reduce the formation of solid residue. The results of pyridine absorption and NH3-TPD measurements indicate that the distribution of Bronsted and Lewis acidic sites over the catalyst has a negligible effect on xylose conversion to aromatics. More acidic sites with higher ratio of weak acid sites could benefit the formation of aromatics with high BTEX selectivity during the xylose conversion. The possible reaction pathway involved in xylose conversion to aromatics is proposed based on pseudo-situ investigations. The findings in this work lead to a better understanding of the chemistry involved in xylose conversion, which could potentially contribute to the cost-efficient utilization of natural gas and biomass.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236119308415?dgcid=author

hua-song-1324439;9;;Communications Chemistry;09-04-2019;The presence of sulfur contaminants in bitumen derived crude oils can lead to rapid catalyst deactivation and is a major problem faced by downstream refiners. Whilst expensive hydrotreating steps may remove much of the sulfur content, it is important to understand how catalyst deactivation by sulfur poisoning occurs and how it may be mitigated. Here we report a mechanistic study of sulfur poisoning over a zeolite catalyst promoted with silver and gallium Lewis acids. Olefin upgrading, an essential process in the refinement of heavy oils, is used as a model reaction. Access to the zeolite inner pores is blocked by bulky, weakly adsorbed sulfur species. Pore access and thus catalyst activity is restored by increasing the reaction temperature. We also show that a simple alkaline treatment greatly improves both the sulfur tolerance and performance of the catalyst. These findings may enhance the rational design of heterogenous catalysts for olefin upgrading.;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-019-0141-4
hua-song-1324439;10;;Fuel;07-03-2019;Biomass utilization is an attractive option for production of fuels and chemicals in the wake of global concern over continuing use of fossil fuels. Biomass can be thermochemically upgraded via gasification, liquefaction or pyrolysis to obtain fuel and/or valuable chemicals. Overall, gasification occurs at high temperature and results in a predominantly gas product. Liquefaction requires relatively low temperature and quite high pressure, and gives a high-quality liquid product. Pyrolysis takes place at moderate temperatures and produces the crude bio-oil. However, the resulting bio-crude is highly oxygenated while containing multiple impurities and disadvantageous to be used as a fuel. Due to the complex and expensive reactor systems associated with liquefaction, pyrolysis is the preferred method for biomass conversion. Hydrotreating or catalytic cracking for the crude oil upgrading either requires large consumption of expensive hydrogen or suffers from low H/C ratios without H2 supply. A novel process named methanolysis allows pyrolysis and catalytic conversion to occur simultaneously under a methane environment, which has shown promise.

hua-song-1324439;11;05;Applied Catalysis B: Environmental;04-03-2019;The co-aromatization of methane with propane is investigated using Zn/HZSM-5 as the catalyst at 400\u2009\u00b0C. The presence of methane has a pronounced effect on the product distribution in terms of improved formation of phenyl rings and substitution groups of aromatic species. Isotopic labeling and solid-state NMR spectroscopy studies reveal that the favored site for methane incorporation varies at different stages along the co-aromatization reaction, from the benzylic sites at the initial stage to the phenyl rings and then substitution groups as the reaction proceeds. SIMS spectroscopy of the involved reaction intermediates suggests the formation of C4 species over the Zn sites that are bonding to the oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework, which is supported by theoretical calculations. The interaction between Zn species and the zeolite framework is also confirmed by XAS and changes in coordination environments are identified through XANES and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The redistribution of Zn during the reaction is observed on the surface of the zeolite support. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy images show that Zn is rich in the inner pores compared with the external surface of the catalyst particles in the pristine catalysts. XANES and XPS spectra demonstrate that the Zn concentration increases on the external surface after the reaction, a conclusion that is further supported by the theoretical study. The Zn redistribution might be among the reasons for methane participation pathway alternation during the co-aromatization, since the Zn species located within the inner pores and on the external surface might prefer to catalyze the methane incorporation to the phenyl rings and substitution groups of the formed aromatics, respectively.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926337319302139?via%%3Dihub

hua-song-1324439;13;;Fuel;02-02-2019;Hydrocracking of naphthalene as a model compound of polyaromatics to mono-aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) had been investigated over various modified zeolite supported catalysts under a mixed hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) atmosphere. Among them, the 5\u202fwt%% Zn/HY (Si:Al ratio of 30) exhibited the best catalytic performance with a naphthalene conversion of 98%% and a BTEX selectivity of 82%%. Compared to those from the control experiment conducted under its H2 and N2 counterparts, the superior catalytic performance achieved under the environment of CH4/H2 mixture leads us to infer that methane presence might exert a positive impact on directing the reaction pathway to produce BTEX during hydrocracking of naphthalene, resulting in notably enhanced liquid yield and BTEX selectivity accompanied with reduced coke formation. Pyridine and ammonia were used as probes to investigate the catalysts\u2019 surface acidity and it was found that Br\u00f8nsted acid sites with moderate medium acidity play an important role in the selective hydrocracking of naphthalene into BTEX under H2 and CH4 environment.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236119301450?dgcid=author
hua-song-1324439;14;;Current Organic Chemistry;01-01-2019;The heavy dependence on fossil fuels raises many concerns on unsustainability and negative environmental impact. Biomass valorization to sustainable chemicals and fuels is an attractive strategy to reduce the reliance on fossil fuel sources. Gasification, liquefaction and pyrolysis are the main thermochemical technologies for biomass conversion. Gasification occurs at high temperature and yields the gas (syngas) as the main product. Liquefaction is conducted at low temperature but high pressure, which mainly produces liquid product with high quality. Biomass pyrolysis is performed at a moderate temperature and gives a primarily liquid product (bio-oil). However, the liquid product from biomass conversion is not advantageous for direct use as a fuel. Compared to liquefaction, pyrolysis is favorable when the aim is to produce the maximum amount of the liquid product from the biomass. Hydrotreating for bio-oil upgrading requires a large amount of expensive hydrogen, making this process costly. Catalytic cracking of bio-oil to reduce the oxygen content leads to a low H/C ratio. Methanolysis is a novel process that utilizes methane instead of hydrogen for biomass conversion. The feasibility studies show that this approach is quite promising. The original complexity of biomass and variation in composition make the composition of the product from biomass conversion unpredictable. Model compounds are employed to better understand the reaction mechanism and develop an optimal catalyst for obtaining the desired product. The major thermochemical technologies and the mechanism based on model compound investigations are reviewed in the article.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/171676
hua-song-1324439;15;;ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering;14-12-2018;A novel hydrogen-free approach is developed to effectively convert phenolic compounds into aromatics including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), a very important and widely used class of petrochemical intermediates, and naphthalene. High yield and selectivity of BTEX are achieved over Zn modified zeolite catalyst during phenol deoxygenation under a methane environment at 400 \u00b0C and 2 MPa. Methane can greatly enhance the liquid yield and selectivity of BTEX, but also improve the catalyst activity. Experimental analysis and mechanistic studies reveal that methane is incorporated into both the methyl group and aromatic ring. The embedding of methane into aromatic compounds is achieved via C-alkylation of phenyl ring, coaromatization with hydrocarbon radicals, and a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism. Liquid- and solid-state NMR investigations make evident the phenyl ring-opening in the reaction. Our mechanistic understanding of this process will provide valuable insights into the chemistry of phenolic deoxygenation, and open perspectives for valorization of biomass-derived oil with cheaper alternatives.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05272
hua-song-1324439;16;05;Fuel;29-11-2018;The co-aromatization of pentane, methane and propane over the Zn-Pt/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates the promoting effect of Pt in terms of higher pentane conversion, higher BTX selectivity and suppressed naphthalene formation, particularly in the presence of methane and propane. DRIFT spectroscopy is employed to probe the evolution of the reactant molecules on the catalyst surface, illustrating the catalytic sites that are not occupied by pentane but available to activate methane and propane molecules. The different adsorption and conversion behaviors of the reactant molecules over the surface catalytic sites are confirmed by isotopic labelling study. The synergetic effect between pentane, methane and propane in the co-aromatization reaction over Zn-Pt/HZSM-5 might be closely related to the variable aromatization performance observed under different reaction conditions. The chemical environment of Zn in the catalysts is probed by XAS technique. The XANES spectra of the catalysts reveal the increased coordination number compared with ZnO reference due to the bonding of Zn with the zeolite framework. The electron transfer from Zn to Pt would alter the electron distribution of the active catalytic sites and thus modify their catalytic activity. The acidity of the catalysts is also modified by the metal loading, which would impose a significant impact on the interaction between the catalyst and the reaction intermediates. The presence of Pt increases the strong acid site concentration that may enhance the activity of the catalyst in the aromatization process. The Zn and Pt particles of catalyst are uniformly dispersed on the catalyst surface as illustrated by TEM and element mapping, which is critical for the interaction between Zn and Pt species and the improved catalytic performance.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236118319756?dgcid=author
hua-song-1324439;17;;Catalysis Science & Technology;01-10-2018;The catalytic co-conversion of cellulose and methane to aromatics was investigated over various Zn-containing zeolite catalysts. Higher aromatic yield (42.3%% C) with BTEX selectivity of 70%% and much lower solid residue yield (char: 9.45%% C) are achieved over 3%%Zn(II)\u2013Zn\u03b4+/ZSM5 (0 < \u03b4 < 2) at 450 \u00b0C and 2.5 MPa. The loading of ZnO clusters or Zn2+ ions could be beneficial for the formation of aromatic products, and the introduction of Zn\u03b4+ species via CVD could improve BTEX selectivity and methane conversion. Co-feeding with methane inhibits the formation of coke or heavy substances and maximizes the carbon utilization efficiency for the formation of aromatics. Methane also enhances the oxygen removal efficiency to improve the quality of the liquid products. Methane participation in the formation of aromatic products is evidenced by liquid 1H, 2H and 13C NMR investigations, which reveal that methane tends to be incorporated into both the methyl group and the phenyl ring. The results of pyridine absorption and NH3-TPD indicate that the balanced distribution of Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites and the appropriate ratio of weak to moderate acidic sites may benefit aromatic formation. XPS and XAS spectra of Zn species confirm the presence of Zn\u03b4+ species with oxygen vacancies, which show a higher selectivity for petrochemicals. The results reported in this work will give more insight into the catalytic chemistry of cellulose valorization under a methane environment and the design of rational catalysts for the cost-efficient utilization of biomass resources and natural gas.;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/cy/c8cy01749b/unauth#!divAbstract
hua-song-1324439;18;05;Fuel;28-09-2018;Selectivity of catalysts has become increasingly important in the petrochemical industry in order to reduce waste, maximize efficiency, and reduce costs. Reported here is a catalyst in the form of Pt-Zn/HZSM-5 with low acidity to reduce over cracking and maximize selectivity of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) during the aromatization of naphtha under methane environment. The Pt-Zn combination when coupled with HZSM-5 support over light straight run naphtha (LSR) and methane, is capable of BTX selectivity of 94.4%% with no formation of detrimental polyaromatics and olefins. Such a performance is attributed to the appropriate distribution of acid sites (seen via NH3-TPD and pyridine DRIFT) with regards to strength and type because of loading Pt and Zn as well as Zn\u2019s ability to reduce coke formation as seen via TGA-DSC (1\u202f\u03bcg coke/(g cat\u00b7h) for Zn/HZSM-5 and 5.9\u202f\u03bcg coke/(g cat\u00b7h) for HZSM-5). TEM imaging shows that a methane environment effectively suppresses metal particle agglomeration (1.4\u202fnm average metal nanoparticle diameter) compared to nitrogen (2.1\u202fnm average metal nanoparticle diameter) with XRD showing Pt\u2019s ability to maintain catalyst crystallinity during moderate temperature and moderate pressure as well as reaction time of 1\u202fh. It has been seen here that by employing Zn and Pt in tandem over HZSM-5, catalytic performance can be greatly increased (22.4%% BTX yield) when compared to sole loading of Zn (13.4%%) or Pt (13.1%%), thus a positive synergetic effect is witnessed. Such a selective and coke resistant catalyst shows great promise for the future of LSR reformation to valuable products with methane as a very feasible co-reactant capable of contributing to positive liquid products.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236118316569
hua-song-1324439;19;02-03;Fuel;15-09-2018;Mo improved Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and characterized, which demonstrated good catalytic performance for thioetherification process of FCC gasoline. The physico-chemical properties of the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with different amounts of Mo were characterized by physical techniques and were correlated with their catalytic performance. Experimental results showed that bimetal (Mo and Ni) based catalysts displayed superior catalytic performance than mono-metal (Ni) based catalysts. Addition of Mo to Ni catalysts could inhibit the formation of NiAl2O4 crystallites and facilitate the formation of active precursor NiMoO4, contributing to the formation of more active sites during the presulfidation process. The micro-morphology of active species was restructured and the needle-stacks of Ni-Mo-S were observed on the Mo improved catalysts. These structures and properties had important influence on the thioetherification. By optimizing the Mo/Ni atomic ratio, the catalysts with a Mo/Ni atomic ratio of 0.3 had suitable micro-morphologies and properties, exhibiting the best catalytic performance and selectivity for thioetherification.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236118315825
hua-song-1324439;20;;Catalysis Science & Technology;30-08-2018;The feasibility of upgrading acetone to fuels and valuable chemicals under a methane environment was investigated over various metal-modified zeolite catalysts at 400 \u00b0C and 3 MPa. Among these, HZSM-5 impregnated with Zn and Ga was found to produce the highest yield of BTEX in comparison to the other prepared catalysts. Catalyst characterization techniques, including XPS, NH3-TPD and TEM, showed that the excellent metal dispersion in the inner pores of the catalyst, a balance of weak, medium and strong acid sites as well as the stable chemical states of Zn and Ga under the methane environment favoured the selectivity towards BTEX. Additionally, the presence of methane could enhance the liquid yield by incorporation into the liquid products, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy through an isotopic-labelling study. These findings lead to a better understanding of the interaction and reaction mechanism involved in the upgrading of biomass-derived ketones under a methane environment for production of fuels and valuable chemicals, which could potentially contribute to a cost-effective substitution of petroleum-derived chemicals and fuels for biomass-derived products.;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/cy/c8cy01544a/unauth#!divAbstract
hua-song-1324439;21;;Bioresource Technology;11-08-2018;Maximizing the production of aromatic hydrocarbons from lignin conversion by coupling methane activation without solvent was investigated over Zn-Ga modified zeolite catalyst. The co-loading of Zn and Ga greatly improves lignin conversion, arene yield along with BTEX (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) selectivity, which gives 37.4\u202fwt%% yield of aromatic hydrocarbons with 62.2\u202fwt%% selectivity towards BTEX at 400\u202f\u00b0C and 3.0\u202fMPa. Methane presence has a negligible impact on lignin conversion, but improves arene yield and BTEX selectivity. Liquid 13C, 1H and 2H NMR investigations confirm the incorporation of methane into the final arene products. The NMR results reveal that methane might be incorporated into both the methyl group and aromatic ring, possibly via methylation of aryl moieties and co-aromatization of alkyl moieties. Pyridine and ammonia as probes for surface acidity analysis of the developed catalysts demonstrate that HZSM5 modification with Zn and Ga species could redistribute BAS (Br\u00f8nsted acid sites) and LAS (Lewis acid sites) and significantly increase the fraction of weak acidic sites on the catalyst, rendering better catalytic performance on the depolymerization of lignin to arene products with higher BTEX selectivity. The results reported in this work may open a novel route to a promising technique for lignin valorization into aromatics and cost-efficient utilizations of biomass and natural gas resources.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960852418311209?via%%3Dihub
hua-song-1324439;22;;ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering;13-06-2018;The technical feasibility of developing a novel process for coupling bioderived furans (furfural) with methane was investigated at mild reaction conditions (400 \u00b0C and 2.5 MPa) over modified zeolite catalysts. Monoaromatics are the main liquid products with high yield, and the oxygen of furfural is removed in the form of CO and CO2. Compared to other zeolite-supported metal catalysts developed in this study, Zn\u2013Ga/ZSM5 shows better catalytic performance on furfural conversion in terms of a higher yield of aromatics, particularly benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), slightly lower gas yield and higher methane conversion. The presence of methane provides carbon atoms that are effectively utilized in the formation of aromatics, and further significantly enhances the yield of aromatics under the facilitation of the charged catalyst. Direct evidence of methane participation in the formation of aromatic products is witnessed by liquid 1H, 2H and 13C NMR investigations, which reveal that methane tends to be incorporated into both the attached methyl groups and aromatic ring, preferentially the benzene ring and the meta position of aromatics. Comprehensive catalyst characterizations, including X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectroscopy, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrate that higher yield of aromatics from furfural conversion might be attributed to better dispersion of Zn and Ga species on the zeolite, abundant acidic sites with an appropriate ratio of weak acid sites to strong acid sites, as well as the stable oxidation state of metal species (Zn2+ and Ga3+). The reaction pathway involved in the furfural conversion to aromatics under methane environment is reasonably hypothesized based on pseudo-situ investigations.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b01257
hua-song-1324439;23;05;Catalysis Today;24-05-2018;The presented work investigates the co-aromatization of methane and propane over Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts. The impact of Al sites, such as framework and extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) sites, on the methane participation pathway during the co-aromatization reaction is explored. The Al sites in the catalysts are manipulated by using ZSM-5 support materials with variable SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios. Post-synthetic treatments, such as the ammonium hexafluorosilicate (AHFS) treatment to remove EFAL and the steam treatment to convert some of the framework Al sites to EFAL sites, are also employed to prepare catalysts and evaluate the contribution of these Al sites to the methane participation pathway. A higher concentration of Al in the catalysts would facilitate the methane participation in the phenyl ring formation. An average carbon number increment of 0.93, a substitution index reduction of 0.028, and an enhanced aromatic carbon fraction by 0.036 among the product molecules are witnessed over the Zn/HZSM-5 (23:1) catalyst during the co-aromatization reaction. This phenomenon is further enhanced when some of the framework Al atoms are converted to the EFAL sites by the steam treatment. The changes of substitution index and aromatic carbon fraction are expanded to 0.045 and 0.055. When the total Al concentration is low in the catalyst, however, the increased EFAL site number at the cost of framework Al sites does not improve methane participation, indicating that the framework Al sites are also crucial for the methane participation. The chemical environment of the Al sites in the catalysts is probed by 27Al solid-state NMR and XAS studies. The NH3-TPD and DRIFTS investigations of the catalysts demonstrate that the framework Al sites and the EFAL sites are closely related to the Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920586118306710
hua-song-1324439;24;05;Applied Catalysis B: Environmental;04-05-2018;The joint conversion of methane and heptane, a model compound of paraffin-rich raffinate oil, over a Zn-Ga modified zeolite catalyst has been investigated at various reaction times. In comparison with the performance from a N2 environment, the introduction of methane highly promotes the formation of light aromatic compounds with a single phenyl ring, and increased carbon number and substitution index of chemical constituents formed are indicative of methane incorporation into the liquid product. In addition, with prolonged time, the interaction between catalyst and methane molecules is enhanced. Through cleavage of methane molecules, the formed moieties likely participate in the aromatization reaction, which results in the growth of larger aromatic components through further condensation. According to the NMR spectra, witnessing methane engagement into the phenyl carbon and alkyl carbon sites of the formed liquid aromatics along with increasing reaction time is evidenced 13C-methane incorporation into aromatics. The excellent catalytic performance of Zn-Ga/ZSM-5 might be ascribed to the greatly dispersed metal species on the catalyst surface as well as a certain amount of medium and weak acid sites. With regards to the spent catalyst, the presence of methane could inhibit the aggregation of loaded active metals and coke formation during the co-aromatization process. The elucidation on the co-conversion of methane and high alkane provides great potential for the utilization of natural gas resources and intermediates formed from petrochemical industries.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926337318304247
hua-song-1324439;25;;Applied Catalysis B: Environmental;22-04-2018;The co-aromatization of methane with olefins is investigated using Ag-Ga/HZSM-5 as the catalyst at 400\u202f\u00b0C. The presence of methane has a pronounced effect on the product distribution in terms of increased average carbon number and substitution index and decreased aromatic carbon fraction compared with its N2 environment counterpart. The participation of methane during the co-aromatization over the Ag-Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst diminishes as the co-fed olefin feedstock molecule becomes larger, from 1-hexene to 1-octene and 1-decene, in diameter. The effect of suppressed methane participation with larger olefinic molecules is not as significant when Ag-Ga/HY is employed as the catalyst, which might be attributed to the larger pore size of HY that gives more room to hold olefin and methane molecules within the inner pores and reduces the diffusion limitation of olefin molecules. The effect of olefin feedstock on the methane participation during the co-aromatization over Ag-Ga/HZSM-5 is experimentally evidenced by 13C and 2D NMR. The incorporation of the methane carbon atoms into the phenyl ring of product molecules is reduced significantly with larger co-fed olefins, whereas its incorporation into the substitution groups of the formed aromatic molecules is not notably affected, suggesting that the methane participation in the phenyl ring formation might preferably occur within inner pores, while its incorporation into substitution groups may mainly take place on external catalytic sites. This hypothesis is well supported by the product selectivity obtained over Ag-Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared using conventional ZSM-5, ZSM-5 with the external catalytic sites deactivated, nanosize ZSM-5, ZSM-5 with a micro/meso pore structure and ZSM-5 with the inner pores blocked, and further confirmed by the isotopic labeling studies.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926337318303631
hua-song-1324439;26;05;Fuel;20-03-2018;The reformation of naphtha to obtain valuable chemical intermediates such as BTX has attracted much attention. Here we report a novel catalytic process whereby a bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst in the form of Zn-Pt/HZSM-5 is applied to a flow reactor system to reform a complex naphtha feed under a methane environment. Different levels of acidity of the HZSM-5 support are tested with a superior performance witnessed using a SiO2:Al2O3 ratio at 80. Further testing is conducted using Zn as a dehydrogenating component with improved performance witnessed when Zn is loaded to a certain degree. A metal promoter is then combined with Zn to compare the effect of different promoters with superior performance witnessed using Ga and Pt as promoters with Zn. BTX selectivity and BTX yield are reported as 86.44%% and 34.22%% respectively under the Zn-Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst. External site coverage improves performance for all bimetallic catalysts with the exception of Zn-Pt/HZSM-5, suggesting that Pt might not promote the migration of metal functions to the internal pores during synthesis. XRD spectra demonstrate that Pt addition results in a more intact crystal structure after reaction when compared to Zn alone\u00b7NH3-TPD and DRIFT analyses show a reduced amount of strong acidic sites upon metal loading with an increase in the number of Lewis acid sites and reduced Br\u00f6nsted sites. This change in acidity could be one of the reasons for an improved performance when Zn-Pt/HZSM-5 is employed. The effect of methane is also witnessed over Zn-Pt/HZSM-5 with improved selectivity, yield (BTX and liquid) and active metal dispersion when compared to a nitrogen environment, suggesting the possible incorporation of methane into the products, BTX in particular. Ultimately, the catalyst employed here opens an avenue for further research into the possible industrial application of naphtha aromatization to form valuable chemical products under methane environment.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236118304514

The benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) components derived from light alkane aromatization were highly promoted with the assistance of methane. The co-existence of Zn and Ga metal species has a positive effect on the formation of BTX components, whereas the individual metal loaded catalyst resulted in the production of heavy aromatics, suggesting that zinc and gallium have a synergistic effect on the formation of BTX under the methane environment. When concerned with gaseous analysis, the introduced methane might interact with smaller intermediates and then transform into larger hydrocarbons. From the DRIFT observation, it was witnessed that the interaction between light alkane and methane occurred on the surface of the charged Zn-Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst. According to the comprehensive catalyst characterizations, the excellent catalytic performance may be closely associated with greatly dispersed metal species on the zeolite support, improved microporous characteristic, moderate Br\u00f6nsted and increased Lewis acidic sites during the paraffin-rich liquid feedstock aromatization under methane environment.

Different catalyst synthesis techniques were compared for their performance on the aromatization of glycerol under a methane environment at 400\u202f\u00b0C and initial pressure of 5\u202fbar. GC\u2013MS analysis showed that the catalyst synthesized using deposition precipitation (DP) resulted in the best performance in terms of the highest yield of monoaromatics in the liquid product when compared with the other synthesis techniques. XRD, NH3-TPD, Pyridine DRIFT, TEM, CO Chemisorption and XAS were employed to better understand the influencing parameters. High crystallinity, high acidity with a higher proportion of medium acid sites and high metal dispersion were identified as the most important factors influencing aromatization performance. Evidently, the deposition precipitation synthesis technique is effective in obtaining each of these attributes. Additionally, a methane environment increased aromatic production when compared to an inert environment. Methane was found to not only maintain high metal dispersion throughout the reaction, but may participate in the reaction as well. The synthesis technique utilized for the upgrading of glycerol can influence the distribution of products, allowing for increased selectivity of the desired product.

hua-song-1324439;29;05;Applied Catalysis B: Environmental;22-04-2017;The massive exploitation of shale gas in the past decade has boosted the production of natural gas and reduced its price dramatically. The methane activation and following conversion into more valuable fuels and chemicals have thus become more and more attractive, while the introduction of hydrocarbons to enhance the methane activation at mild conditions represents a promising approach. In the present work, the co-aromatization of methane with propylene has been studied at 400 \u00b0C. The presence of methane would increase the toluene to benzene ratio as well as the average carbon number of the formed liquid aromatic products compared to its propylene alone counterpart. Among the gas products, the formations of C3H8, C4H8 and C4H10 also get promoted when methane is present. The incorporation of methane into the product molecules is also directly evidenced by the 1H, 2D and 13C NMR spectroscopy of the liquid products obtained from the reaction between propylene (or styrene) and isotope labelled methane. Hydrogen from methane would contribute a large portion of the hydrogen in the product molecules, while the benzylic and aromatic hydrogen sites are favored compared with those on the alkyl side chains. The activation of methane is also observed in the DRIFT spectra when deuterium enriched methane is engaged as the methane source and evidenced by the escalated exothermic feature when olefin aromatization takes place under methane environment. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-Ga/ZSM-5 might be because of the better dispersion of Ag and Ga on the ZSM-5 surface and moderate amount of strong Br\u00f6sted and Lewis surface acid sites. All the observations suggest that methane might be activated nonoxidatively and converted into aromatics if suitable catalyst is charged under the assistance of co-existing olefin. The reported synergetic effect could potentially lead to the more economic utilization of abundant natural gas and petrochemical intermediates.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337317303521
hua-song-1324439;30;;ACS Catalysis;19-04-2017;The technical feasibility of coaromatization of acetic acid derived from biomass and methane was investigated under mild reaction conditions (400 \u00b0C and 30 bar) over silver-, zinc-, and/or gallium-modified zeolite catalysts. On the basis of GC-MS, Micro-GC, and TGA analysis, more light aromatic hydrocarbons, less phenol formation, lower coke production, and higher methane conversion are observed over 5%%Zn-1%%Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst in comparison with catalytic performance over the other catalysts. Direct evidence of methane incorporation into aromatics over 5%%Zn-1%%Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst is witnessed in 1H, 2H, and 13C NMR spectra, revealing that the carbon from methane prefers to occupy the phenyl carbon sites and the benzylic carbon sites, and the hydrogen of methane favors the aromatic and benzylic substitutions of product molecules. In combination with the 13C NMR results for isotopically labeled acetic acid (13CH3COOH and CH313COOH), it can be seen that the methyl and carbonyl carbons of acetic acid are equally involved in the formation of ortho, meta and para carbons of the aromatics, whereas the phenyl carbons directly bonded with alkyl substituent groups and benzylic carbons are derived mainly from the carboxyl carbon of acetic acid. After various catalyst characterizations by using TEM, XRD, DRIFT, NH3-TPD, and XPS, the excellent catalytic performance might be closely related to the highly dispersed zinc and gallium species on the zeolite support, moderate surface acidity, and an appropriate ratio of weak acidic sites to strong acidic sites as well as the fairly stable oxidation state during acetic acid conversion under a methane environment. Two mechanisms of the coaromatization of acetic acid and methane have also been proposed after consulting all the collected data in this study. The results reported in this paper could potentially lead to more cost-effective utilization of abundant natural gas and biomass.;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.7b00296

Not only is the olefin content reduced, which is critical for the storage and transportation of oil products, but also are high value-added products produced from methane. The study on the reaction intermediates during this process is crucial for a better understanding of the involved catalytic reaction mechanism as well as catalyst development. Catalysts that displayed high selectivity towards olefin upgrading including Ir/ZSM-5 and Pd/ZSM-5 in our previous research are studied in this work. CD4 is employed as the methane source in the reaction to track the evolution of hydrogen in the methane molecule. The significant change of the allylic hydrogen peak on 1H\u2009NMR spectra upon CD4 introduction demonstrates that the hydrogen sites on the carbon atoms adjacent to the double bond moieties are selectively occupied by deuterium atoms, suggesting that these sites are preferred by methane hydrogen atoms and may play a key role in the reaction pathway. The evolution of methane and the interaction between methane and olefin over the catalyst are observed in the DRIFT spectra. The IR resonance due to O\u2212D stretching of the terminal silanol hydroxyl group at 2753\u2005cm\u22121 is observed under CD4 environment, while the O\u2212D stretching of bridging hydroxyl group is not detected, indicating the interaction between methane and the catalyst is highly selective, which may contribute to the high selectivity in methane hydrogen evolution.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/slct.201601625/full

Hydrotreating where expensive hydrogen is involved at high pressure (15\u201320 MPa) is commonly employed as the technique to satisfy the upgrading requirement. In this study, it is reported that a partially upgraded crude oil can be readily produced from bitumen under a methane environment at mild conditions (400 \u00b0C and 3 MPa) without H2 engagement under the facilitation of 1%%Ag-5%%Mo-10%%Ce/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 23:1). Moreover, methane participation into the upgrading process was evidenced by model compound reactions employing n-butylbenzene as a model compound to typify heavy oil and clearly observed in 1H and 2D NMR spectra when CD4 was engaged as the methane source. Through extensive catalyst characterizations using TEM, XRD, and XPS, the excellent catalytic upgrading performance might be closely related to the highly dispersed silver and molybdenum oxide on the zeolite support at reduced oxidation state for better methane activation and partially reduced cerium oxide for coke reduction owing to its high oxygen mobility. The outcomes from this research could not only create an innovative route for more profitable natural gas utilization but also benefit bitumen partial upgrading in a more economical and environmentally friendly way.;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b02374
hua-song-1324439;33;05;Fuel Processing Technology;21-09-2016;Partial upgrading of viscous heavy oil, such as bitumen extracted from Canadian oil sands, to meet the specifications of pipeline transportation is highly desired. Conventionally, this is achieved by catalytic hydrotreating under a hydrogen pressure of 15\u201320 MPa, which consumes naturally unavailable hydrogen. Recently a novel methanotreating technology using methane, the principal component of natural gas, as the hydrogen donor has been explored over metal modified zeolites to catalyze the upgrading process. In the present work, the formula of the catalyst was optimized in terms of the species of metal cations, morphology of the support materials and acidity of the support. The catalytic performance was evaluated by comparing the viscosity and coke formation as well as compatibility of the product oil upon methanotreating. When a silver and gallium cation modified ZSM-5 with a silica to alumina ratio of 30:1 was used to catalyze the upgrading of heavy oil at 380 \u00b0C and 5 MPa, the viscosity of heavy oil was reduced to 278 mPa \u2219 s at 25 \u00b0C with an acceptable coke yield of 0.8 wt.%% and without compromising the compatibility of the resulting oil product, which were desirable for pipeline transportation and downstream refining. This study demonstrates the feasibility of upgrading heavy oil with natural gas at fairly mild operation conditions instead of expensive hydrogen at rather stringent ones.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378382016305057

PdOx species (basic oxides) anchored on the strong acidic sites (Br\u00f6nsted acid sites) of zeolite support could not only generate new acidic sites with moderate acidic strength but also exhibit good capability for H2 activation and dissociation. The conversion of 1-decene is 100%% and total selectivity of methyl-nonane is 98.4 \u00b1 0.4%% at 350 \u00b0C.

hua-song-1324439;36;05;Applied Catalysis B: Environmental;21-08-2016;Upgrading olefin in the synthetic oil to alkane is highly desired due to its high volatility and thermal unstability as well as low energy density. Unlike conventional hydrotreating, methane (CH4) was used in this study as the novel hydrogen donor for olefin saturation. The significant increase of H/C atomic ratio of product oil from 1.69 \u00b1 0.02 (over pure ZSM-5) to 2.04 \u00b1 0.02 (over Ir/ZSM-5 (10.0)) and the alkane content up to 83.8 \u00b1 2.1%% in the upgraded oil indicated that methane could exhibit comparable catalytic performance to what hydrogen (H2) did for olefin (1-Decene) upgrading over the developed bifunctional catalysts with low Ir loadings. The HRTEM and XPS data revealed that the highly dispersed metallic Ir particles with average size of 1.32 nm was coexisting with IrO2 species. The synergic effects of Ir/IrO2 obviously promoted the activation of methane, which supplied sufficient hydrogen for the saturation and stabilization of olefin. The results from BET indicated that the pore size and volume of the ZSM-5 support were increased upon Ir introduction, which provided more active sites for cracking olefin (1-decene). NH3-TPD results suggested that the presence of highly dispersed Ir increased the amount of surface acidity, which enhanced the formation and stabilization of carbenium ion intermediates. As a result, the produced alkanes were mainly composed of cyclopentane-derived compounds, like propylcyclopentane, 3-methylbutyl-cyclopentane and 1,2,4-trimethyl-cyclopentane, which has great application potential as immersion fluid and additive in the field of optics and petroleum.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337316306555
hua-song-1324439;37;05;Fuel;29-06-2016;Olefin content minimization is critical for the long-term storage and long-distance transportation of oil product, which is commonly achieved through hydrogen saturation at high pressure to form paraffin. In this study, a novel catalytic process is reported to convert olefin to cycloalkane under methane environment with high selectivity. The main components of the product oil collected over Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts during olefin model compound (i.e., 1-decene) upgrading are cyclopentane, 1-methylbutyl- and cyclopentane, hexyl- while there are more than 46 species identified in the liquid product from the run with H-ZSM-5 support engaged. The total selectivity of the aforementioned cycloalkane products is up to 91.3%% when 0.27 wt%% Pd/ZSM-5 catalyst is charged, thus making the product oil more profitable. The HRTEM and XPS data reveal that the highly dispersed palladium particles are in the form of PdOx. The results from pyridine FT-IR and NH3-TPD indicate that these PdOx species anchored onto the surface acidic sites exhibit the moderate acidic feature of Lewis acidic sites, which enhances the formation and stabilization of carbenium ion intermediates generated from 1-decene cracking. The strong interaction between PdOx species and surface acidic sites could not only stabilize the particle size and modify the electronic structure of Pd species but also modulate the acidic properties of ZSM-5 support, leading to promoted methane activation which would not only release sufficient hydrogen donors for preventing olefin aromatization, but also inhibit the over-cracking of carbenium ions. As a result, the selectivity of catalyst assisted olefin cyclization under methane environment is greatly enhanced.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236116305269
hua-song-1324439;38;05;Fuel;10-06-2016;The upgrading of the petroleum cracking distillates using cheap methane rather than naturally unavailable hydrogen is an economically attractive process. This work clearly demonstrates the feasibility of methanotreating by directly using methane over zeolite-supported catalyst to convert olefins. The introduction of methane decreases the fraction of olefins and increases the fraction of paraffins in the liquid products obtained from the reaction using 1-decene as the olefin model compound when Ag-Ga/ZSM-5 is charged. It also improves the quality of liquid product in terms of higher H/C atomic ratio, higher heating value and lower bromine number. The interaction between olefins and methane on the surface of the catalyst is evidenced by DRIFT spectroscopy. When propylene is used as the olefin model compound, the shift of the peaks due to the interaction between adsorbed propylene species and catalyst surface as well as the generation of new peaks after the introduction of methane are observed. When 1-decene is used as the model compound, the suppressed intensity of CC signal and enhanced alkane CH bending peak intensity when CH4 is present indicate the conversion of olefins into paraffins. The improved particle dispersion of the charged catalyst upon the reaction under CH4 environment is also noticed from the TEM images, which might be closely related to its better olefin upgrading performance. The outcomes from this study might create an alternative route for cracked distillates upgrading and provide a positive attempt for more valuable methane utilization.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236116304495
hua-song-1324439;39;;Applied Catalysis B: Environmental;06-06-2016;This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of simultaneously converting ethanol and methane into liquid hydrocarbons at mild reaction conditions (400 \u00b0C and 1 atm) over silver and/or zinc modified zeolite catalysts. After GC\u2013MS analysis, it is worth noting that aromatics are the major compounds contained in the liquid product collected from the run when 1%%Ag/ZSM-5, particularly after H2 pretreatment, is charged. Compared to the performance exhibited from the run with pure HZSM-5 support engaged, Ag addition into the HZSM-5 framework favors aromatics formation, which might be closely associated with better Ag dispersion and more abundance of strong surface acidic sites where aromatization might take place while Zn loading exerts a detrimental effect on the production of aromatics but promotes the ether generation possibly through dehydration reaction. Referred to that from its N2 counterpart, the increased aromatics formation of the collected liquid product when methane is present indicates that methane existence might facilitate ethanol aromatization. Moreover, combined with the increased carbon number in the formed aromatics from CH4 run when H2 run is referred and zero liquid formation from CH4-alone test as well as more prominent endothermic feature of methane run and more importantly the notably increased 13C signals in 13C NMR spectra of the liquid product collected during ethanol conversion under 13CH4 environment, all the observations suggest that methane might be activated nonoxidatively and converted into higher hydrocarbons, preferentially into aromatics if suitable catalyst is charged under the assistance of co-existing oxygenated hydrocarbon. The reported synergetic effect could potentially lead to the more economic utilization of abundant natural gas and cellulosic ethanol.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337316304519
hua-song-1324439;40;;Waste Management;28-12-2015;Biomass fast pyrolysis followed by hydrodeoxygenation upgrading is the most popular way to produce upgraded bio-oil from biomass. This process requires large quantities of expensive hydrogen and operates under high pressure condition (70\u2013140 atm). Therefore, a novel methanolysis (i.e., biomass pyrolysis under methane environment) process is developed in this study, which is effective in upgraded bio-oil formation at atmospheric pressure and at about 400\u2013600 \u00b0C. Instead of using pure methane, simulated biogas (60%% CH4 + 40%% CO2) was used to test the feasibility of this novel methanolysis process for the conversion of different solid wastes. The bio-oil obtained from canola straw is slightly less than that from sawdust in term of quantity, but the oil quality from canola straw is better in terms of lower acidity, lower Bromine Number, higher H/C atomic ratio and lower O/C atomic ratio. The municipal solid waste and newspaper can also obtain relatively high oil yields, but the oil qualities of them are both lower than those from sawdust and canola straw. Compared with catalysts of 5%%Zn/ZSM-5 and 1%%Ag/ZSM-5, the 5%%Zn\u20131%%Ag/ZSM-5 catalyst performed much better in terms of upgraded bio-oil yield as well as oil quality. During the methanolysis process, the metal silver may be used to reduce the total acid number of the oil while the metal zinc might act to decrease the bromine number of the oil. The highly dispersed Zn and Ag species on/in the catalyst benefit the achievement of better upgrading performance and make it be a very promising catalyst for bio-oil upgrading by biogas.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X15302518
hua-song-1324439;41;02;Energy & Fuels;26-10-2015;The inherent CO2 gasification reactivities of chars derived from a series of plentiful carbon sources, including petroleum coke (petcoke), coal with various ranks, biomass, and even municipal solid wastes, have been systematically investigated in this work. Among these, switchgrass char exhibits the best activity, while petcoke char behaves the worst toward CO production. The results from sample characterizations indicate that the inherent char reactivity during CO2 gasification is closely related to its physical properties such as the alkali metal and oxygen contents as well as the H/C atomic ratio. In addition, the effect of the reaction conditions (i.e., temperature, pressure, space velocity, particle size of char, and CO and CO2 concentrations in the gas feedstock) on char CO2 gasification has also been explored. Moreover, a set of supported catalysts have been developed to further promote the char reactivity toward CO2 gasification at moderate temperature, among which K\u2013Ca/ZnO\u2013CeO2 ranks at the top in terms of CO2 conversion and CO production and demonstrates excellent stability during a long-term cumulative run. Through careful analyses of the collected catalyst characterization results, a novel catalyst design composed of two redox metal/metal oxide pairs supported on an oxygen ion conductor, based on the reported K\u2013Ca/ZnO\u2013CeO2 system, has been proposed for future catalyst development with even better CO2 gasification performance for fluidized bed applications with much easier catalyst recovery and thus minimized catalyst loss.;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b01712

In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to the development of low-temperature SCR catalysts for both stationary sources and diesel engines. Mn-based catalysts have attracted great attention due to their excellent low-temperature activity. However, vulnerability to SO2 and H2O poisoning and preference for N2O formation make these catalysts still far away from industrial application. V2O5 loaded on carbon materials has shown both high SCR activity and SO2 tolerance at low-temperature. This type of catalyst is very promising for applications in low-temperature SCR for stationary sources. Recently, Cu-containing small pore zeolites, such as Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34 with a CHA structure and Cu-SSZ-39 and Cu-SAPO-18 with an AEI structure, were shown to have very high activity at low temperature and excellent hydrothermal stability at high temperature and thus received much attention for applications on diesel vehicles.

The thermal treatment was completed in a static autoclave and the pyrolysis was run at 500 \u00b0C according to a standard test (i.e. the MCR test, ASTM D4530). The pyrolysis coupled with the polarized light microscopic observation of the coke products provided a quantitative and convenient method for predictive assessment of the stability of a given feed. It was strongly suggested that atmospheric gas oil distillate (AGO) was not conducive to the stability of blends. The recycle ratio of AGO and light vacuum gas oil distillate (LVGO) had better be confined to around 0.1 and the valid upper limitation of recycle ratio for heavy vacuum gas oil distillate (HVGO) could be increased up to 0.6 for the purpose of digesting ill-processable vacuum gas oil fraction (VGO). It was concluded that appropriate selection of recycled fraction and ratio might not only favor the improvement of coking products distribution and the process capacity debottleneck, but also be beneficial for maintaining the stability of coking feedstock, suppressing asphaltenes-involved phase separation in the exchanger sections at high temperature, and consequentially favor the operation period extending of coking plants.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016523701400165X

The supported catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and characterized through N2 physisorption, H2 chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature programmed calcination, temperature programmed reduction, temperature programmed oxidation, thermogravimetric analysis, ethanol pulse chemisorption, and temperature programmed reaction techniques. The synthesis parameters examined include calcination temperature, reduction temperature, and reduction time. The catalyst evolution at different stages of the synthesis process was investigated. The ethanol adsorption and temperature programmed reaction experiments indicated a strong correlation between the catalytic activity and metallic cobalt surface area for the 10 wt%% Co\u2013ZrO2 catalyst.;null

Withinentrepreneurial clusters research, infrastructure includes universities, researchinstitutions and telecommunication technologies that facilitate entrepreneurialactivities. These capital-intensive investments seek to facilitate start-upsemergence by aiding access to markets and development of ideas.Accelerators facilitate the same activities and have only recently been conceptualizedas start-up infrastructure. This study builds upon this researchstream by elaborating on how accelerators can play this meaningful role atthe cluster level. Specifically, and by relying on the analysis of empiricalevidence from three distinct studies, we uncover how accelerators providetangible and intangible dimensions of start-up infrastructure to form a positivelyreinforcing cycle of entrepreneurial activities. Additionally, our findingsallow us to push further the idea that start-up infrastructure development canbe an endogenous process involving multiple actors within the cluster.

ricardo-flores-2735341;8;;Journal of International Business Studies;27-06-2013;"International business (IB) research has long acknowledged the importance of supranational regional factors in building models to explain phenomena such as where multinational corporations (MNCs) choose to locate. Yet criteria for defining regions based on similar factors vary substantially, thus undermining consensus regarding which regional grouping schemes fit IB research models better. In response, we develop and empirically validate a theory of comparative regional scheme assessment for model-building purposes assuming that: (1) schemes can be classified based on their source of similarity; and (2) schemes within the same similarity class can be assessed for their structural coherence, based on group contiguity and compactness. Schemes with better structural coherence will also exhibit better fit with IB research models. We document support for our theory in comparative analyses of regional schemes used to explain where US-based MNCs locate operations around the world. Geography-, culture- and trade and investment-based schemes with better structural coherence exhibit better initial fit with MNC location models and less change in fit after modest scheme refinement using a simulated annealing optimization algorithm.

Second, we explore the underlying reasons of location change by focusing on country-level factors, accounting for firm-, industry- and regional-level explanations. Our findings suggest, first, that the extent of MNCs' activities around the globe is more extensive than assumed by regionalists' arguments and well beyond Ohmae's TRIAD, but still less widespread than claimed by the globalists \u2013 the two main traditions within the globalization\u2013regionalization debate.

Simultaneously, the reduction potential in terms of the EF of the food products has also been estimated by suggesting the installation of some sustainable technologies.The ecological footprint of packaged pickle, jam, honey and chutney products have been estimated as 1.67, 0.54, 15.94 and 2.18 gha/ton, respectively. The overall bio-productive land that had the maximum involvement for the food products\u2019 processing at the industry was Cropland (85.7%%) followed by CO2 absorption land (11.2%%).

The CDI integrates all the three (social, economic and environmental) aspects of sustainable development, along with peace and happiness. As proposed, the CDI is based on four parameters, i.e. Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI), Scaled Green Index, Scaled Peace Index and Scaled Happiness Index, evaluated from globally accepted standard databases.

chen-turkenitz-227bb55;1;;Research Disclosure;08-11-2014;During printing in Large Format Printers there is a need to print on different media types. Usually there is media handling device like vacuum table or drum with defined vacuum power by vacuum pump and nipples installed. In the media handling mechanism. Ability to control vacuum power is low. In additional if there is generic malfunction and print actually happened on table or drum those nipples become blocked and the only work around is to perform  a maintenance procedure, such as manual cleaning of the nipples.  Current method provides ability to replace segments of nipples in media handling mechanism that can solve two main issues.;https://rd.orbit.com/rd/search/RD607071.pdf

dedi-gadot-49567328;1;;CVPR, 2017;25-02-2017;We show that the matching problem that underlies optical flow requires multiple strategies, depending on the amount of image motion and other factors. We then study the implications of this observation on training a deep neural network for representing image patches in the context of descriptor based optical flow. We propose a metric learning method, which selects suitable negative samples based on the nature of the true match. This type of training produces a network that displays multiple strategies depending on the input and leads to state of the art results on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 optical flow benchmarks.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05607

We suggest using a Siamese CNN to independently, and in parallel, compute the descriptors of both images. The learned descriptors are then compared efficiently using the L2 norm and do not require network processing of patch pairs. The success of the method is based on an innovative loss function that computes higher moments of the loss distributions for each training batch. Combined with an Approximate Nearest Neighbor patch matching method and a flow interpolation technique, state of the art performance is obtained on the most challenging and competitive optical flow benchmarks.;http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01815

rotem-gershon-phd-12762b1b;1;;Stem Cell Reports;01-05-2017;SummaryDuring nephrogenesis, stem/progenitor cells differentiate and give rise to early nephron structures that segment to proximal and distal nephron cell types. Previously, we prospectively isolated progenitors from human fetal kidney (hFK) utilizing a combination of surface markers. However, upon culture nephron progenitors differentiated and could not be robustly maintained in-vitro. Here, by culturing hFK in a modified media used for in vitro growth of mouse nephron progenitors and dissection of NCAM+CD133- progenitor cells according to EpCAM expression (NCAM+/CD133-/EpCAM-, NCAM+/CD133-/EpCAMdim, NCAM+/CD133-/EpCAMbright) we show at single cell resolution preservation of uninduced and induced cap mesenchyme as well as a transiting mesenchymal-epithelial state. Concomitantly, differentiating and differentiated epithelial lineages are also maintained.In-vitro expansion of discrete stages of early human nephrogenesis in nephron stem cell cultures may be used for drug screening on a full repertoire of developing kidney cells and for prospective isolation of mesenchymal or epithelial renal lineages for regenerative medicine.;null
rotem-gershon-phd-12762b1b;2;;Scientific Reports;01-12-2015;"ABSTRACT: When assembling a nephron during development a multipotent stem cell pool becomes restricted as differentiation ensues. A faulty differentiation arrest in this process leads to transformation and initiation of a Wilms\u2019 tumor. Mapping these transitions with respective surface markers affords accessibility to specific cell subpopulations. NCAM1 and CD133 have been previously suggested to mark human renal progenitor populations. Herein, using cell sorting, RNA sequencing, in vitro studies with serum-free media and in vivo xenotransplantation we demonstrate a sequential map that links human kidney development and tumorigenesis; In nephrogenesis, NCAM1+CD133\u2212 marks SIX2+ multipotent renal stem cells transiting to NCAM1+CD133+ differentiating segment-specific SIX2\u2212 epithelial progenitors and NCAM1\u2212CD133+ differentiated nephron cells. In tumorigenesis, NCAM1+CD133\u2212 marks SIX2+ blastema that includes the ALDH1+ WT cancer stem/initiating cells, while NCAM1+CD133+ and NCAM1\u2212CD133+ specifying early and late epithelial differentiation, are severely restricted in tumor initiation capacity and tumor self-renewal. Thus, negative selection for CD133 is required for defining NCAM1+ nephron stem cells in normal and malignant nephrogenesis.";null
rotem-gershon-phd-12762b1b;3;;EMBO Molecular Medicine;01-10-2013;ABSTRACT: Identification of tissue-specific renal stem/progenitor cells with nephrogenic potential is a critical step in developing cell-based therapies for renal disease. In the human kidney, stem/progenitor cells are induced into the nephrogenic pathway to form nephrons until the 34 week of gestation, and no equivalent cell types can be traced in the adult kidney. Human nephron progenitor cells (hNPCs) have yet to be isolated. Here we show that growth of human foetal kidneys in serum-free defined conditions and prospective isolation of NCAM1(+) cells selects for nephron lineage that includes the SIX2-positive cap mesenchyme cells identifying a mitotically active population with in vitro clonogenic and stem/progenitor properties. After transplantation in the chick embryo, these cells-but not differentiated counterparts-efficiently formed various nephron tubule types. hNPCs engrafted and integrated in diseased murine kidneys and treatment of renal failure in the 5/6 nephrectomy kidney injury model had beneficial effects on renal function halting disease progression. These findings constitute the first definition of an intrinsic nephron precursor population, with major potential for cell-based therapeutic strategies and modelling of kidney disease.;null

We designed and optimized a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) genotyping assay to detect FOXL2 C402G mutation in DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. We examined 20 tumor samples obtained from Israeli patients diagnosed with granulose cell tumor. Eighteen out of 20 samples were found to harbor FOXL2 C402G mutation. Pathological review of the two tumors harboring wild type FOXL2 (C402) concluded that they were adenocarcinomas and has been misclassified at initial diagnosis. We found that the prevalence of FOXL2 mutations among Israeli patients with GCT (100%%) is similar to previous reports. Our results indicate that the FOXL2 mutations can be reliably detected by MALDI-TOF-MS genotyping. MALDI-TOF-MS genotyping is a simple, robust and highly sensitive method to detect FOXL2 C402G mutation. Our results confirm previous studies reporting over 95%% prevalence of FOXL2 mutation in GCT. Furthermore, we suggest that testing for the presence of the FOXL2 C402G mutation may improve diagnostic accuracy.;null

White women reported less confidence and less assertiveness in their salary requests and proposed lower first offers than did White men; Asian and Asian American participants did not show gender differences in these measures. Negotiation backlash, measured by the amount that participants felt they could request without being punished for being too demanding, mediated the relation between demographic factors and first offers. We explored outcomes in light of intersectionality theories and the status incongruity hypothesis of backlash.

The present research explored the impact of gender\u2212professional identity integration (GPII), a measure of how much two identities overlap, on job satisfaction and organizational commitment, as well as on likelihood to pursue externally visible credentials, for male nurses. Analyses of data collected from 178 male nurses demonstrated that GPII significantly predicted job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and that perceived respect of nursing partially mediated this relationship. Evidence for the association between GPII and externally visible credentials was mixed, and perceived respect of nursing did not mediate this relationship. We discuss the implications of these findings for men in nursing, including the importance of perceived respect of one\u2019s occupation in formation of positive job attitudes.;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-04659-001/
smorglobal;6;;Academy of Management Learning and Education;29-05-2013;"For managers, intercultural effectiveness requires forging close working relationships with people from different cultural backgrounds (Black, Mendenhall, & Oddou, 1991). Recent research with executives finds that higher cultural metacognition is associated with affective closeness and creative collaboration in intercultural relationships (Chua, Morris, & Mor, 2012). However, little is known about the social cognitive mechanisms that facilitate the performance of individuals high on cultural metacognition. We propose that one important question for cross-cultural research and training is identifying which metacognitive strategies enable successful intercultural collaborations. In the present paper, we suggest that one such strategy is \""cultural perspective taking\"" - considering how another's cultural background shapes their behavior in a given context. We hypothesized that cultural perspective taking facilitates intercultural coordination and cooperation, and that a manipulation boosting cultural perspective taking would be especially beneficial for individuals low in dispositional cultural metacognition. We found support for the above hypotheses in five studies using both quasi-field and experimental approaches. We discuss the implications of the present findings for literatures on expatriate managers, cross-cultural training, cultural intelligence and intercultural negotiations.";http://m.amle.aom.org/content/early/2013/05/29/amle.2012.0202

smorglobal;11;2019;SSRN;null;The present research aims to explain within-gender differences in negotiation performance by introducing an individual difference approach to the gender and negotiations literature. We propose that women who perceive their gender and professional roles as compatible\u2014high on gender/professional identity integration\u2014display a behavioral repertoire that facilitates competitive negotiation performance. Identity integration was positively associated with economic performance and the absence of social backlash among women (but not men) (Study 1A), and reduced social backlash concerns (Study 1B). In Study 2, women high on identity integration negotiated higher salaries for themselves without incurring social backlash. These effects were mediated by behaviors associated with female (warmth) and professional identities (dominance). Our final studies experimentally manipulated identity integration and revealed that inducing high identity integration (Study 3A) activated goals to combine warmth with dominance, while inducing low identity integration (Study 3B) decreased women\u2019s intentions to do so.;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2451067

This review article describes the early research and development response in Israel under the scope of in-hospital patient care, such as non-contact sensing of patients\u2019 vital signs, and how it could potentially be weaved into a practical big picture at the hospital or national level using a strategic management system.;https://www.rmmj.org.il/userimages/1119/1/PublishFiles/1128Article.pdf
ronnie-abbo-md-1371251;3;;Journal of the American Heart Association;14-11-2018;Background-\u2014Right heart catheterization is the gold standard in clinical practice for the assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics, but it is an invasive procedure requiring expertise in both insertion and reading. Remote dielectric sensing (ReDS) is a noninvasive electromagnetic-based technology intended to quantify lung fluid content.Methods and Results-\u2014In this prospective single-center study, ReDS readings were obtained in supine position just before right heart catheterization procedure in patients with heart failure. Agreement between ReDS and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) was analyzed. Of all, 139 patients with heart failure received hemodynamic assessment and ReDS measurement. A good correlation was found between ReDS and PAWP measurement (r=0.492, P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the ability to identify a PAWP \u226518 mm Hg resulted in a ReDS cutoff value of 34%%, with an area under the curve of 0.848, a sensitivity of 90.7%%, and a specificity of 77.1%%. Overall, ReDS <34%% carries a high negative predictive value of 94.9%%.Conclusions-\u2014Lung fluid content, as measured by ReDS, correlates well with PAWP. The high sensitivity and specificity and especially the high negative predictive value make ReDS a reliable noninvasive tool at the point of care, to rule out elevated PAWP in patients with heart failure and to help with medical management of patients with heart failure. Further studies are warranted to compare this tool with existing tests and to relate the findings to the clinical outcomes.;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.118.009175
ronnie-abbo-md-1371251;4;;International Journal of Cardiology;04-03-2017;We tested whether remote dielectric sensing (ReDS)-directed fluid management reduces readmissions in patients recently hospitalized for heart failure (HF). Pulmonary congestion is the most common cause of worsening heart failure (HF) leading to hospitalization. Accurate remote monitoring of lung fluid volume may guide optimal treatment and prevent re-hospitalization. ReDS technology is a quantitative non-invasive method for measuring absolute lung fluid volume.Patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF were enrolled during their index admission and followed at home for 90\u2005days post-discharge. Daily ReDS readings were obtained using a wearable vest, and were used as a guide to optimizing HF therapy, with a goal of maintaining normal lung fluid content. Comparisons of the number of HF hospitalizations during ReDS-guided HF therapy were made, both to the 90\u2005days prior to enrollment and to the 90\u2005days following discontinuation of ReDS monitoring.Results:Fifty patients were enrolled, discharged, and followed at home for 76.9\u2005\u00b1\u200526.2\u2005days. Patients were 73.8\u2005\u00b1\u200510.3\u2005years old, 40%% had LVEF above 40%%, and 38%% were women. Compared to the pre- and post-ReDS periods, there were 87%% and 79%% reductions in the rate of HF hospitalizations, respectively, during ReDS-guided HF therapy. The hazard ratio between the ReDS and the pre-ReDS period was 0.07 (95%% CI [0.01\u20130.54] p\u2005=\u20050.01), and between the ReDS and the post-ReDS period was 0.11 (95%% CI [0.014\u20130.88] p\u2005=\u20050.037).Conclusions:These findings suggest that ReDS-guided management has the potential to reduce HF readmissions in acute decompensated HF patients recently discharged from the hospital.;http://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/article/S0167-5273(16)32225-2/fulltext

avishai-levi-b807b372;1;;Chemical Communications;21-08-2017;Addition of intramolecular cross-links to linear polymers significantly improves their resistance to mechanochemical fragmentation, and hence the physical properties of polymer solutions are maintained under shear. However, while fragmentation is suppressed, mechanochemistry of chemical bonds still occurs. In linear polymers, the rate of mechanochemistry has been shown to increase linearly with the degree of polymerisation. Here, we report a systematic study of the mechanochemical fragmentation of a series of polymers with increasing polymer length, linear and intramolecularly collapsed, in order to understand the correlation between destructing and non-damaging mechanochemical events. By comparing the trends of the fragmentation kinetic rate vs. the degree of polymerisation, the effect of intramolecular collapse on fundamental mechanochemistry parameters such as the limiting molecular weight and stabilisation effect can be further understood.;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/cc/c7cc04885h#!divAbstract
avishai-levi-b807b372;2;;Angewandte Chemie International Edition;02-05-2017;Many of the attractive properties in polymers are a consequence of their high molecular weight and therefore, scission of chains due to mechanochemistry leads to deterioration in properties and performance. Intramolecular cross-links are systematically added to linear chains, slowing down mechanochemical degradation to the point where the chains become virtually invincible to shear in solution. Our approach mimics the immunoglobulin-like domains of Titin, whose structure directs mechanical force towards the scission of sacrificial intramolecular hydrogen bonds, absorbing mechanical energy while unfolding. The kinetics of the mechanochemical reactions supports this hypothesis, as the polymer properties are maintained while high rates of mechanochemistry are observed. Our results demonstrate that polymers with intramolecular cross-links can be used to make solutions which, even under severe shear, maintain key properties such as viscosity.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201612242/abstract
avishai-levi-b807b372;3;;Electrochimica Acta;01-10-2015;The one-pot anodic thiocyanation and isothiocyanation of alkenes in both acidic two-phase (water-dichloromethane) and homogeneous one-phase (water-acetonitrile) media has been studied. Optimisation experiments on tetramethylethylene as a model alkene involved the use of different acids, anodes, current densities, charge consumption and electrolysis methods. In the two-phase medium mainly two addition products (in moderate yields) of SCN/NCS (major) and two SCN/SCN groups were formed. Other alkyl substituted alkenes also yielded similar addition products but those involving two SCN groups became the major ones. In addition, also allylic thiocyanato and isothiocyanato substitution products were observed, but in lower yields. Activated alkenes such as, styrene, indene and butylvinyl ether did not yield addition products, whereas 1,1-diphenylethylene and 2,3-dimethylfuran gave substitution products exclusively.Under homogeneous one-phase aqueous-acetonitrile medium the formation of SCN/OH adducts became prominent in all cases, including those of styrene and indene. Also they all afforded the corresponding SCN/SCN and SCN/NCS addition products. However 1,1-diphenylethylene gave a sole vinylic substitution product whereas 2,3-dimethylfuran did not react.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468615301948

or-inbar-573a6742;1;;Pulmonary Medicine;31-05-2021;AbstractObjective. At present, there is no consensus on the best strategy for interpreting the cardiopulmonary exercise test\u2019s (CPET) results. This study is aimed at assessing the potential of using computer-aided algorithms to evaluate CPET data for identifying chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods. Data from 234 CPET files from the Pulmonary Institute, at Sheba Medical Center, and the Givat-Washington College, both in Israel, were selected for this study.The selected CPET files included patients with confirmed primary CHF (n = 73), COPD (n = 75), and healthy subjects (n = 86). Of the 234 CPETs, 150 (50 in each group) tests were used for the support vector machine (SVM) learning stage, and the remaining 84 tests were used for the model validation. The performance of the SVM interpretive module was assessed by comparing its interpretation output with the conventional clinical diagnosis using distribution analysis. Results. The disease classification results show that the overall predictive power of the proposed interpretive model ranged from 96%% to 100%%, indicating very high predictive power. Furthermore, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall recision of the proposed interpretive module were 99%%, 99%%, and 99%%, respectively. Conclusions. The proposed new computer-aided CPET interpretive module was found to be highly sensitive and specific in classifying patients with CHF or COPD, or healthy. Comparable modules may well be applied to additional and larger populations (pathologies and exercise limitations), thereby making this tool powerful and clinically applicable.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/pm/2021/5516248/

omersharon;1;1984;Sleep Medicine;01-12-2018;BACKGROUND:REM sleep (REMS) is considered vital for supporting well-being and normal cognition. However, it remains unclear if and how decreases in REMS impair cognitive abilities. Rare case studies of patients with REMS abolishment due to pontine lesions remain sporadic, and formal evaluation of cognitive status is lacking. In 1984, Lavie and colleagues described the case of Y.C. - a man with a pontine lesion and near-total absence of REMS who led a normal life. Here, we set out to re-evaluate this individual's REMS status 30 years after the original report, and formally assess his cognitive abilities.METHODS:Four whole-night polysomnographic sleep recordings were conducted to evaluate sleep architecture. Sleep scoring was performed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines. Cranial Computed Tomography (CT) imaging was performed, as well as formal neuropsychological testing to evaluate cognitive functions.RESULTS:Y.C. averaged 4.5%% of sleep time in REMS, corresponding to the 0.055 percentile of normal values for his age. Furthermore, residual REMS episodes were short and only occurred towards the end of the night. CT imaging revealed damage and metallic fragments in pons, cerebellum, and thalamus. Neuropsychological evaluation demonstrated average to high-average cognitive skills, normal memory, and motor difficulties including speech and left hand dyspraxia.CONCLUSIONS:To our knowledge, this is the only case where REMS loss resulting from pontine lesion was re-evaluated after many years. We find a near-total absence of REMS with no signs of significant compensation throughout adult life, along with normal cognitive status. The results provide a unique perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the functional role of REMS in supporting cognition.;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321820
omersharon;2;;August 9, 2017;09-08-2017;The extent to which the sleeping brain processes sensory information remains unclear. This is particularly true for continuous and complex stimuli such as speech, in which information is organized into hierarchically embedded structures. Recently, novel metrics for assessing the neural representation of continuous speech have been developed using noninvasive brain recordings that have thus far only been tested during wakefulness. Here we investigated, for the first time, the sleeping brain's capacity to process continuous speech at different hierarchical levels using a newly developed Concurrent Hierarchical Tracking (CHT) approach that allows monitoring the neural representation and processing-depth of continuous speech online. Speech sequences were compiled with syllables, words, phrases, and sentences occurring at fixed time intervals such that different linguistic levels correspond to distinct frequencies. This enabled us to distinguish their neural signatures in brain activity. We compared the neural tracking of intelligible versus unintelligible (scrambled and foreign) speech across states of wakefulness and sleep using high-density EEG in humans. We found that neural tracking of stimulus acoustics was comparable across wakefulness and sleep and similar across all conditions regardless of speech intelligibility. In contrast, neural tracking of higher-order linguistic constructs (words, phrases, and sentences) was only observed for intelligible speech during wakefulness and could not be detected at all during nonrapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. These results suggest that, whereas low-level auditory processing is relatively preserved during sleep, higher-level hierarchical linguistic parsing is severely disrupted, thereby revealing the capacity and limits of language processing during sleep;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28626013
omersharon;3;;Cerebral Cortex;25-02-2017;AbstractDuring sleep, external sensory events rarely elicit a behavioral response or affect perception. However, how sensory processing differs between wakefulness and sleep remains unclear. A major difficulty in this field stems from using brief auditory stimuli that often trigger nonspecific high-amplitude \u201cK-complex\u201d responses and complicate interpretation. To overcome this challenge, here we delivered periodic visual flicker stimulation across sleep and wakefulness while recording high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. We found that onset responses can be separated from frequency-specific steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) selectively observed over visual cortex. Sustained SSVEPs in response to fast (8/10 Hz) stimulation are substantially stronger in wakefulness than in both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, whereas SSVEP responses to slow (3/5 Hz) stimulation are stronger in both NREM and REM sleep than in wakefulness. Despite wake-like spontaneous activity, responses in REM sleep were similar to those in NREM sleep and different than wakefulness, in accordance with perceptual disconnection during REM sleep. Finally, analysis of amplitude and phase in single trials revealed that stronger fast SSVEPs in wakefulness are driven by more consistent phase locking and increased induced power. These results suggest that the sleeping brain is unable to effectively synchronize large neuronal populations in response to rapid sensory stimulation.;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/3052755/Attenuated-Fast-Steady-State-Visual-Evoked

In part, this is because the commentary was in some respects a scandal, and scholars accordingly believe it may hold the key to resolving present-day disagreements on how to interpret al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b's views as expressed in his independent treatises. Perhaps al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b's most shocking or scandalous statement is that preserved by the Hispano-Muslim philosophers Ibn B\u0101jja, Ibn \u1e6cufayl, and Ibn Rushd. According to them al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b says in his commentary on Aristotle's Ethica Nicomachea that happiness is to be achieved only in this life, not in the afterlife; that there is no happiness but political happiness; and that union with the active intellect \u2013 generally considered the highest goal of human existence by the philosophers \u2013 is impossible. This paper addresses the following questions: What exactly is the debate about? Why is the question of immortality or conjunction related to Aristotle's Ethica Nicomachea? And why was it so controversial to say, in the context of the Ethica Nicomachea, that there is no happiness but political happiness? Although the bulk of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b's commentary is still lost, I have discovered two quotations of it in Hebrew manuscripts. As I will argue in this paper, these newly-discovered quotations \u2013 which are included with an English translation in the appendix \u2013 can shed light on the mysteries concerning al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b's commentary.";http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0957423912000082

david-l-b82910a3;1;;IEEE Access;17-03-2021;This paper addresses the problem of expanding a seed of known malicious domains related to the same malware campaign to categorize unknown domains as malicious and related to this malware campaign.We developed a novel algorithm to detect malicious domains and relate them to a specific malware campaign in a large-scale real-data DNS traffic environment, dubbed Identification of MaliciousDomain Campaigns (IMDoC) algorithm. Its novelty resides in developing a framework that combines the existence of communicating files for the observed domains and their DNS request patterns in a realproduction environment. The analysis was conducted on real data from Quad9 (9.9.9.9) DNS recursive resolvers combined with malicious communicating files extracted from VirusTotal, and confirms the strong performance of the algorithm on a real large-scale data production environment.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381197

tal-bauman-47ab31a9;1;;Nature Medicine;02-06-2020;"The rapid and global spread of COVID-19 led the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. One factor contributing to the spread of the pandemic is the lack of information about who is infected, in large part because of the lack of testing. This facilitated the silent spread of the causative coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which led to delays in public-health and government responses and an explosion in cases. In countries that have tested more aggressively and that had the capacity to transparently share this data, such as South Korea and Singapore, the spread of disease has been greatly slowed1.Although efforts are underway around the world to substantially ramp up testing capacity, technology-driven approaches to collecting self-reported information can fill an immediate need and complement official diagnostic results. This type of approach has been used for tracking other diseases, notably influenza2. The information collected may include health status that is self-reported through surveys, including those from mobile apps; results of diagnostic laboratory tests; and other static and real-time geospatial data. The collection of privacy-protected information from volunteers about health status over time may enable researchers to leverage these data to predict, respond to and learn about the spread of COVID-19. Given the global nature of the disease, we aim to form an international consortium, tentatively named the \u2018Coronavirus Census Collective\u2019, to serve as a hub for amassing this type of data and to create a unified platform for global epidemiological data collection and analysis.";https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0929-x
tal-bauman-47ab31a9;2;19;Nature Medicine;09-04-2020;In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated, after a cluster of patients in China were diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown cause. This new isolate was named \u2018SARS-CoV-2\u2019 and is the cause of the disease COVID-19. The virus has led to an ongoing outbreak and an unprecedented international health crisis. The number of infected people is rapidly increasing globally and most probably is a vast underestimation of the real number of patients worldwide, as infected people are contagious even when minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic. The spread of the disease has presented an extreme challenge to the international community, and policy-makers from different countries have each chosen different strategies, depending on the local spread of the virus, healthcare-system resources, economic and political factors, public adherence, and their perception of the situation.;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0857-9
tal-bauman-47ab31a9;3;;ISPRS;16-09-2019;"Reliable and accurate geospatial-databases (Digital Elevation Models, DEMs) are an essential component of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). One of their most important uses is change detection \u2013 an invaluable tool for environmental interpretation and evidence-based action. High-performance and inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for the acquisition of timely geospatial information (imagery) for the production of DEMs for geospatial change detection. DEMs produced from UAV imagery have very high resolution and very good internal accuracy. However, their absolute location accuracy is inferior to other mapping technologies. Therefore, existing change detection methods, which are based on the point-by-point comparison, will perform poorly when processing DEMs created from UAV imagery since they are limited in reliably separating real physical changes from artifacts related to DEM inherent inaccuracy or errors. This paper presents a novel methodology that overcomes these deficiencies, by implementing a hierarchical analysis and modeling process, in which a sequence of methods is used to automatically identify and match unique homological features, such as building corners or topographic maxima, in the various height models. These provide geospatial anchors that bring out local geospatial discrepancies between the models. Those are then used to \""repair\"" (align) the models to the same geospatial reference system, at which point change-detection is performed. Experimental results showed that when calculating point-by-point height differences, 98.99%% of the area was falsely classified as changed, whereas implementing our method adequately detected all the actual changes in the area with no false positives, correctly classifying 0.16%% of the area as changed.";https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-2-W16/47/2019/

omri-faingold-42ab7432;1;01-21;PLoS Pathog;04-05-2018;The ability of the Lentivirus HIV-1 to inhibit T-cell activation by its gp41 fusion protein is well documented, yet limited data exists regarding other viral fusion proteins. HIV-1 utilizes membrane binding region of gp41 to inhibit T-cell receptor (TCR) complex activation. Here we examined whether this T-cell suppression strategy is unique to the HIV-1 gp41. We focused on T-cell modulation by the gp21 fusion peptide (FP) of the Human T-lymphotropic Virus 1 (HTLV-1), a Deltaretrovirus that like HIV infects CD4+ T-cells. Using mouse and human in-vitro T-cell models together with in-vivo T-cell hyper activation mouse model, we reveal that HTLV-1's FP inhibits T-cell activation and unlike the HIV FP, bypasses the TCR complex. HTLV FP inhibition induces a decrease in Th1 and an elevation in Th2 responses observed in mRNA, cytokine and transcription factor profiles. Administration of the HTLV FP in a T-cell hyper activation mouse model of multiple sclerosis alleviated symptoms and delayed disease onset. We further pinpointed the modulatory region within HTLV-1's FP to the same region previously identified as the HIV-1 FP active region, suggesting that through convergent evolution both viruses have obtained the ability to modulate T-cells using the same region of their fusion protein. Overall, our findings suggest that fusion protein based T-cell modulation may be a common viral trait.;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727445/

nimrod-hirsh-035982b2;1;;Finance Research Letters;05-05-2015;We examine the association between a pyramidal ownership structure and the intensity of high-tech companies\u2019 investments in innovation. We find that companies in pyramidal business groups invest in innovation with greater intensity than similar companies that are not part of such an ownership structure. Furthermore, the intensity of investment in innovation is significantly higher the lower the firm is situated in the pyramid, where the ultimate owner has a smaller share of the equity. However, these findings are statistically significant only for biotechnology firms. It seems that for biotech companies, the pyramidal structure serves to transfer the immense investment risk inherent in them away from the ultimate owners further down the pyramid where they have a lower stake in profits and losses. In that sense, the inclusion of biotech firms further down the pyramid is, in effect, a particular kind of tunneling.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612315000057

galina-blokh;7;2019;Israel Tech Challenge/;09-08-2020;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFrTpXq790&feature=youtu.beVarious platforms, like Quora or SO or chat-bots  need to find duplicating questions in order to optimize resources. Also, some services need to find the closest questions and to recommend them to the user. We deployed the model that provides the solution! We used data with >400K of question pairs to train our models to predict if a given pair of questions is duplicate. The preprocessing part included lemmatization (optional), stop-words removing and embedding (based on training corpora). Based on this data we implemented new features: distance-based pairwise features and features for a single question.Next, we considered some classic ML algorithms like Random Forest and Boosting methods on initial and balanced data (using SMOTE and weights) and reached accuracy up to 84%%. Besides that, we tested some NNs with different architecture and got accuracy up to 85%%. These models allowed us to create an application that not only predicts duplicates but also gives a list of closest questions to the user\u2019s input.(c)Mariia Padalko, Anna Roitberg, Galina Blokh, Vladimir Gurevich;https://www.itc.tech/itsallaboutthedata

avner-cohen-90065640;2;;J. Chem. Phys.;12-10-2012;The microscopic structure of fluids of simple spheres is well known. However, the constituents ofmost real-life fluids are non-spherical, leading to a coupling between the rotational and translationaldegrees of freedom. The structure of simple dense fluids of spheroids \u2013 ellipsoids of revolution \u2013 was only recently determined by direct experimental techniques [A. P. Cohen, E. Janai, E.Mogilko, A. B .Schofield, and E. Sloutskin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 238301 (2011)]. Using confocal microscopy, it was demonstrated that the structure of these simple fluids cannot be described by hard particle models based on the widely used Percus-Yevick approximation. In this paper, we describe a new protocol for determining the shape of the experimental spheroids, which allows us to expand our previous microscopy measurements of these fluids. To avoid the approximations in the theoretical approach, we have also used molecular dynamics simulations to reproduce the experimental radial distribution functions g(r) and estimate the contribution of charge effects to the interactions. Accounting for these charge effects within the Percus-Yevick framework leads to similar agreement with the experiment.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4765100
avner-cohen-90065640;3;;Phys. Rev. Lett;02-12-2011;A fluid of spheroids, ellipsoids of revolution, is among the simplest models of the disordered matter,where positional and rotational degrees of freedom of the constituent particles are coupled. However, while highly anisometric rods, and hard spheres, were intensively studied in the last decades, the structure of a fluid of spheroids is still unknown.We reconstruct the structure of a simple fluid of spheroids, employing direct confocal imaging of colloids, in three dimensions. The ratio t between the polar axis and the equatorial diameter for both our prolate and oblate spheroids is not far from unity, which gives rise to a delicate interplay between rotations and translations. Strikingly, the measured positional interparticle correlations are significantly stronger than theoretically predicted, indicating that further theoretical attention is required, to fully understand the coupling between translations and rotations in these fundamental fluids.;http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.238301

maor-battat-a225a3177;1;;Plant Physiology;12-02-2019;The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional regulation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (Petunia hybrida) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum di-glycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II (EOBI, EOBII), which together with ODO1 co-regulate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by controlling TRANSKETOLASE2 expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism, and compare this mechanism to petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein-triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.;https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00009

dan-malowany-78b2b21;1;;Algorithms special Issue on Bio-Inspired Algorithms for Image Processing;11-07-2020;Computer vision is currently one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields of science, which affects numerous industries. Research and development breakthroughs, mainly in the field of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), opened the way to unprecedented sensitivity and precision in object detection and recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the findings in recent years on the sensitivity of neural networks to additive noise, light conditions, and to the wholeness of the training dataset, indicate that this technology still lacks the robustness needed for the autonomous robotic industry. In an attempt to bring computer vision algorithms closer to the capabilities of a human operator, the mechanisms of the human visual system was analyzed in this work. Recent studies show that the mechanisms behind the recognition process in the human brain include continuous generation of predictions based on prior knowledge of the world. These predictions enable rapid generation of contextual hypotheses that bias the outcome of the recognition process. This mechanism is especially advantageous in situations of uncertainty, when visual input is ambiguous. In addition, the human visual system continuously updates its knowledge about the world based on the gaps between its prediction and the visual feedback. CNNs are feed forward in nature and lack such top-down contextual attenuation mechanisms. As a result, although they process massive amounts of visual information during their operation, the information is not transformed into knowledge that can be used to generate contextual predictions and improve their performance. In this work, an architecture was designed that aims to integrate the concepts behind the top-down prediction and learning processes of the human visual system with the state-of-the-art bottom-up object recognition models, e.g., deep CNNs. The work focuses on two mechanisms of the human visual system: anticipation-driven perception and reinforcement-driven learning.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/13/7/167
dan-malowany-78b2b21;2;;IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology;12-06-2018;Light conditions affect the performance of computer vision algorithms by creating spatial changes in color and intensity across a scene. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) use color components of the input image and as a result are sensitive to ambient light conditions. This work analyzes the influence of ambient light conditions on CNN classifiers. We suggest a method ]for boosting the performance of CNN-based object detection and classification algorithms by using Light Invariant Video Imaging (LIVI). LIVI neutralizes the influence of ambient light conditions and renders the perceived object\u2019s appearance independent of the light conditions. Training sets consist mainly, if not only, of objects in natural light conditions. As such, using LIVI boosts CNN performance by matching object appearance to that expected by the CNN model, which was created according to the training set. We further investigate the use of LIVI as a general self-supervised learning framework for CNN. Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN) was used as a case study in order to validate the importance of light conditions on CNN performance and on how it can be improved by using LIVI as an input or feedback mechanism in a self-supervised framework. We show that LIVI enables reduced CNN size, enhanced performance and improved training.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8382234/
dan-malowany-78b2b21;3;;IEEE International Conference on the Science of Electrical Engineering (ICSEE);05-01-2017;In recent years, unmanned systems reached a maturity level that resulted in the adoption of robotic system for both civil and military usages. As the amount of unmanned systems increases, the amount of visual information that is being sent to the end user increases, and the need to develop the unmanned systems ability to autonomously alert the user on predefined events is being emphasized. This ability is mainly based on their capability to detect and classify the objects in their field of operation. Recent studies shows that the mechanism behind the recognition process in the human brain includes continuous generation of predictions based on prior knowledge about the world. These predictions enable rapid generation of hypothesis that biases the outcome of the recognition process in situation of uncertainty. In addition, the visual system continuously updating its knowledge about the world based on visual feedback. In our work, we formed an architecture that is based on the concepts behind these top-down prediction and learning processes of the human visual system, together with state of the art bottom-up object recognition models, e.g. deep CNNs. We show that imitating these top-down reinforcement learning mechanisms, together with the state of the art bottom-up feed-forward algorithm, creates an accurate and continuously improving target recognition model.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7806151/
dan-malowany-78b2b21;4;;IEEE 28th Convention of Electrical & Electronics Engineers in Israel (IEEEI);12-01-2015;As the quantity of visual information sources increases, the need to develop sensors that can automatically alert the user to exceptional events is being emphasized. This feature incorporates the ability to detect and classify the targets they \u201csee\u201d. Achieving this goal will dramatically improve the efficiency of CCTV-based security systems, improve search/retrieval engines, increase the autonomy of robotic systems and will contribute in many other areas of life. The performance of the human visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems. Remarkable in particular, is the human brain high accuracy in ultra rapid object categorization tasks. Recent studies shows that the mechanism behind the recognition process includes predictions based on prior knowledge about the world. These predictions enable rapid generation of hypothesis that biases the outcome of the recognition process in situation of uncertainty. In this work, we implemented the concepts behind this top-down prediction mechanism of the human visual system. This work focus on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) role in the prediction process, which appears to be attuned to the associative content of visual information and to facilitate recognition of sensory inputs via predictive feedback to sensory cortices. Specifically, coarse representations reach the OFC, which generate \u201cinitial guesses\u201d regarding the targets identity. These predictions are projected to the inferior temporal cortex, which facilitate perception and select the most likely interpretations. We show that imitating this mechanism can potentially create more robust target recognition models than exist today.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?arnumber=7005884

eldad-eshed-a9534612;1;;A book;01-01-2009;The significant part of Mongolian economy is pastoral agriculture, which is a traditional scope of activity and main source of income for the rural population. Study of the natural vegetation dynamics is of essential interest both for decision-makers and herdsmen. During the last decades, Mongolia has suffered from prolonged droughts in combination with extensive grazing in many areas. This situation requires frequent monitoring environmental conditions and the state of pastures. This is an important and challenging security task for Mongolia since weather station network is limited for effective special monitoring and providing services and advises to decision-makers and herdsmen. During 1985\u20132004, the NOAA-AVHRR Global Vegetation Index (GVI) data set and its Vegetation Health (VH) products have been studied and used for analysis of pastoral changes in Mongolia. This paper discusses application of VH for early drought detection (one of the leading environmental disasters), monitoring drought impacts on pasture conditions and estimation of biomass production.;https://books.google.co.il/books?id=dfzvCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=eldad+eshed+and+mongolia&source=bl&ots=jBasSOHtsd&sig=lexx-jSf9aSiKAEF_fhXi4E9RhQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAWoVChMIvOCq9rvCxwIVcC_bCh2Ufg1W#v=onepage&q=eldad%%20eshed%%20and%%20mongolia&f=fa

roseanne-kheir-farraj-phd-04219982;1;;Mentoring and Tutoring: Partnership in Learning;16-05-2013;This paper examines the nature of moral dilemmas mentors from three different national groups (Jewish, Druze, and Arab) encounter in their work in Israeli Arab schools, how they manage these dilemmas in practice, and how the nature of particular dilemmas might connect to their management strategies. Given the multicultural and politically conflictive context of the Israeli society, a cultural and political reading of in-service mentors\u2019 moral dilemmas reveals that mentors\u2019 encounter and management of recurrent moral dilemmas is embedded in cultural and political issues in a way that seem to hinder their mentoring practice. Preparation programs for mentors need to highlight awareness of mentors\u2019 own culture and that of their mentees in order to implement a culturally and politically responsive practice;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13611267.2013.784060#.UoqFsKMUGM8

avi-klein-7301b273;1;;IEEE Photonics Journal;22-05-2019;We suggest a time-lens array with a filling factor of 200%% and increased resolution of 60%% without decreasing the number of lenses in the array. This time-lens array is based on a series of orthogonally polarized time-lenses. We investigate the different nonlinear interactions and show that when the pump waves of two adjacent time-lenses have orthogonal states of polarization, it is possible to overlap by 50%% without unwanted nonlinear interactions.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8720008
avi-klein-7301b273;2;;Optica;01-07-2018;Fiber lasers are convenient for studying extreme and rare events, such as rogue waves, thanks to the lasers\u2019 fast dynamics. Indeed, several types of rogue wave patterns were observed in fiber lasers at different time-scales: single peak, twin peak, and triple peak. We measured the statistics of these ultrafast rogue wave patterns with a time lens and developed a numerical model proving that the patterns of the ultrafast rogue waves were generated by thenon-instantaneous relaxation of the saturable absorber together with the polarization mode dispersion of the cavity. Our results indicate that the dynamics of the saturable absorber is directly related to the dynamics ofultrafast extreme events in lasers.;https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-7-774
avi-klein-7301b273;3;;Optics Letters;15-04-2018;We developed a full-Stokes temporal imaging system whichmeasures the Stokes vector of ultrafast signals as a functionof time.

avi-klein-7301b273;4;01;IEEE Journal of Lightwave Technology;01-03-2018;Modern networks implement multi-layer encryption architecture to increase network security, stability, and robustness. Encryption on the lower layers is essential for the safety of the entire network traffic. However, at the lower layers, the data rate is at its highest, and any latency affects the network bandwidth and reduces performance. The best solution to prevent latency is to resort to optical devices that operate at the optical transfer rate which can revolutionize the field. We developed a new paradigm for optical encryption based on the strengths of optics over electronics and according to temporal optics principles and demonstrated a highly efficient all-optical encryption scheme for modern networks. Specifically, we utilize dispersion together with nonlinear interaction for mixing neighboring bits with a private key. The security of the system is not based on encryption algorithms but on the physical properties of photo-detectors which are not able to read long ultra-fast signals. Our system encrypts the entire network traffic with low latency, encrypt the signal itself, exploit only one nonlinear interaction, it is energetically efficient with low ecologic footprint, and can be added to current networks without replacing the hardware such as the lasers, the transmitters, the routers, the amplifiers or the receivers. Our method can replace current slow encryption methods or can be added to increase the security of existing systems;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305457/
avi-klein-7301b273;5;;IEEE;07-04-2017;We developed time-lens which can optically process pulses with orthogonal polarization. Our time-lenses can be implemented in current telecommunication systems together with polarization division multiplexing in order to reach higher bandwidth;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7894243/?reload=true
avi-klein-7301b273;6;;Optica;01-01-2017;Temporal optics is an emerging field in which optical signals are considered similarly to objects in spatial optics. Indeed, temporal magnifications, temporal Fourier transform, and temporal signal processing have been demonstrated by adopting optical schemes from space to time. However, temporal imaging has so far focused on the equivalent of two-dimensional spatial imaging schemes, while ignoring the depth of the input. Here we adopt the concept of three-dimensional (3D) imaging into the time domain, providing a new dimension in temporal optics. We developed the concept of temporal 3D objects and demonstrated temporal depth imaging. First, we define signals with temporal depth as signals where each point in time has a different dispersion value. Next, we demonstrate how to measure these signals with a moving time lens. Finally, we present a time lens array and use it to realize temporal depth imaging with a single measurement. Our temporal depth imaging concept will enable measurements of ultrafast nonperiodic phenomena, such as optical rogue waves and the evolution of ultrafast pulses in fiber lasers, with temporal resolution that was not possible until now.;https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.4.000502
avi-klein-7301b273;7;;OSA Continuum;null;Rogue waves, which were first described as an oceanographic phenomenon, constitute an important factor in the dynamics of many physical systems. Most of these systems were analyzed by scalar fields, while some of them, and specifically in optics, are described by a vector field. Thus, they differ from scalar systems in several crucial aspects. In this work, we study experimentally twin-peak rogue waves with a temporal imaging system capable of measuring the Stokes vectors as a function of time. We found that the two peaks in optical twin-peak rogue waves have orthogonal states of polarization and similar intensities. We observed this with two different systems, however, we do not have a theoretical explanation for this phenomena and could not explain it with current models.;https://www.osapublishing.org/osac/abstract.cfm?uri=osac-2-11-3102

ohadinbar;1;;Interactions;01-07-2009;Traditionally, the focus of HCI has been designing for people who actively use applications or interactive products. These individuals, commonly referred to as users, may be bank tellers operating a banking application, pilots setting parameters of an autopilot system, or customers using ATM machines. This viewpoint neglects a vast number of cases in which human interactions with computerized systems are less active and often unplanned, yet still meaningful. People\u2019s needs are routinely ignored in these situations and the effects of information systems on their lives often go unnoticed. We term these people \u201cincidental users.\u201d;http://interactions.acm.org/content/?p=1269

lior-zatlavi-10865441;1;;Algorithmic Finance;05-12-2014;The stock market index is one of the main tools used by investors and financial managers to describe the market and compare the returns on specific investments. Common approaches to index calculation rely on a company's market value generating a weighted average as the index. This work presents new methods of computing adaptive stock market indices based on dynamical properties of the underlying index constituents, and introduces measures to evaluate their performance. The premise behind this work is that the influence of each stock on other stocks should be a major factor in determining the weight given to each stock in the index composition. The methodologies presented here provide the means to construct a dynamic adaptive index, which can be used as a benchmark for the underlying dynamics of the market. We investigate the components of the S&P500 index, and the components of the TA25 index, representing a large (NYSE) and a small (TASE) developed market, respectively. We focus our study on periods before and during the 2008 Sub-prime mortgage crisis. Our results provide evidence that the adaptive-indices provide an effective tool for policy and decision makers to monitor the stability and dynamics of the markets, and identify bubble formation and their ensuing collapse.;http://iospress.metapress.com/content/t785635626328g87/

adi-dagan-41660765;1;;International Journal of Mental Health and Addictio;20-01-2017;"This cross sectional study examined alcohol use, binge drinking and other problem behavior among Israeli university female students. Scant information is known about Israeli university student alcohol use and related problem behavior. Academic study discipline status (e.g., social work, nursing and other non-helping disciplines) was hypothesized to be a predictor of university student alcohol use and problem behavior rates. Study hypotheses were supported, in part. Academic discipline (social work and nursing) differentiated rates of alcohol use, binge drinking and other problem behavior. However, when grouped into helping and non-helping academic disciples, few differences were evidenced. Students drink more beer, wine and hard alcohol than those 20 years ago at the same university; however, fewer students drive after drinking. Present results, albeit restricted, reflect increased drinking but less driving after drinking after an intensive campaign to curb such problem behavior. Further research is needed of alcohol use and problem behavior for policy, prevention and treatmentpurposes. Such research should include regular monitoring throughout the country regardless of gender status and academic discipline.";null

otavioesteves;1;00;Opp News;28-01-2014;O que os americanos t\u00eam?Recentemente tive a oportunidade de passar 14 dias em Nova York. Experi\u00eancia \u00fanica, surpreendente e que com certeza ainda se repetir\u00e1 algumas vezes em minha vida.Tinha anseio por todos os pontos tur\u00edsticos, loca\u00e7\u00f5es de filmes, pr\u00e9dios e pontos hist\u00f3ricos (como Dakota e WTC), m\u00fasicos pelos metr\u00f4s e ruas, etc...Mas algo em espec\u00edfico me inquietava e aumentava ainda mais minha ansiedade. \u00c1vido por Comportamento do Consumidor, fui focado em descobrir: O que os americanos t\u00eam? Qual \u00e9 realmente o grande diferencial deles? Por que s\u00e3o considerados refer\u00eancias em marketing?Depois de muito observar pontos fortes e fracos, em diversas lojas de varejo, restaurantes, lanchonetes, museus, parques, mercados e farm\u00e1cias, constatei que apenas uma define o que fui buscar l\u00e1:Eles lidam com pessoas!Todos dentro de qualquer estabelecimento est\u00e3o ali \u00e0 disposi\u00e7\u00e3o do cliente. Independente da sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o dentro da loja, ao menor sinal de d\u00favida, eles param o que estiverem fazendo e voltam-se 100%% a voc\u00ea. E \u00e9 algo muito natural a eles, \u00e9 intr\u00ednseco \u00e0 cultura local.  Voc\u00ea se sente realmente especial e \u00fanico.Atendimento de alto n\u00edvel \u00e9 algo que valorizo muito. Afinal, \u00e9 o grande pecado do varejo no Brasil, em minha opini\u00e3o.Sinergia dos colaboradores, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do cliente, \u00e9 algo que pautamos e defendemos com unhas e dentes nas estrat\u00e9gias que desenvolvemos na Opp Mais e Consiglieri Brasil. N\u00e3o \u00e9 algo simples, exige planejamento, treinamento e disciplina.Poderia escrever muito mais sobre minhas sensa\u00e7\u00f5es em NY, comparativos com a nossa realidade ou at\u00e9 a forma que encaramos isso e buscamos solu\u00e7\u00f5es para nossos clientes.Mas o tempo aqui \u00e9 curto, deixamos ent\u00e3o para um pr\u00f3ximo bate-papo.Abra\u00e7os e Feliz 2014 a todos.;http://www.oppmais.com.br/noticiaVisualizar/52

ohad-toledano-9261b65b;1;24;Int J Biol Markers;24-03-2014;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from an inappropriate inflammatory response in which genetic, immune, and environmental factors all play important roles. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD24 gene have been associated with the development of several autoimmune diseases.AIM:To evaluate whether CD24 SNPs, are associated with risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).METHODS:The CD24 polymorphisms C170T (rs8734), TG1527del (rs3838646), A1626G (rs1058881), and A1056G (rs1058818) were assessed in a case-control study of an Israeli cohort comprising 117 IBD patients and 105 age and gender-matched healthy controls. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed using BstX1, Bsr1, Mfe1, and BstU1 restriction enzymes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression models.RESULTS:Carriers of the C170T SNP were at increased risk of IBD (OR=3.022, 95%% CI: 1.748-5.223, p=0.001), UC (OR=3.002, 95%% CI: 1.661-5.427, p=0.001) and CD (OR=3.077, 95%% CI: 1.334-7.095, p=0.008). Carrying the A1626G and A1056G SNPs was found to be a risk factor for IBD (OR=2.460, 95%% CI: 1.420-4.259, p=0.001 and OR=1.856, 95%% CI: 1.011-3.405, p=0.01), UC (OR=2.218, 95%% CI: 1.207-4.075, p=0.01 and OR=1.944, 95%% CI: 0.995-3.798, p=0.01) but not for CD (p=0.086 and p=0.299). The A1626G and TG1527del were found to be associated with younger age of IBD onset (p=0.022 and p=0.027, respectively).CONCLUSIONS:The CD24 C170T polymorphism is associated with IBD risk. The A1626G and A1056G SNPs might be associated only with UC risk. These findings suggest CD24 as a new genetic susceptibility factor, with clinical implications in the prediction of IBD prognosis and therapy.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557789

sergei-rudnizky-bb770a68;1;;Molecular Cell;29-06-2021;Chromatosomes play a fundamental role in chromatin regulation, but a detailed understanding of their structure is lacking, partially due to their complex dynamics. Using single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers, we reveal that linker histone interactions with DNA are remarkably extended, with the C-terminal domain binding both DNA linkers as far as approximately \u00b1140 bp from the dyad. In addition to a symmetrical compaction of the nucleosome core governed by globular domain contacts at the dyad, the C-terminal domain compacts the nucleosome\u2019s entry and exit. These interactions are dynamic, exhibit rapid binding and dissociation, are sensitive to phosphorylation of a specific residue, and are crucial to determining the symmetry of the chromatosome\u2019s core. Extensive unzipping of the linker DNA, which mimics its invasion by motor proteins, shifts H1 into an asymmetric, off-dyad configuration and triggers nucleosome decompaction, highlighting the plasticity of the chromatosome structure and its potential regulatory role.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.06.006

Here, we present a single-molecule assay that exploits the thermal fluctuations of a DNA hairpin, to detect the association and dissociation of individual, unlabeled transcription factors. We demonstrate this new approach by following the binding of Egr1 to its consensus motif and the three binding sites found in the promoter of the Lhb gene, and find that both association and dissociation are modulated by the 9 bp core motif and the sequences around it. In addition, CpG methylation modulates the dissociation kinetics in a sequence and position-dependent manner, which can both stabilize or destabilize the complex. Together, our findings show how variations in sequence and methylation patterns synergistically extend the spectrum of a protein\u2019s binding properties, and demonstrate how the proposed approach can provide new insights on the function of transcription factors.;https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.444789

In humans, this plasticity includes age of pubertal onset, hormone levels and age at menopause. These reproductive characteristics vary across populations with distinct lifestyles and following specific childhood events, and point to a role for the early-life environment in shaping adult reproductive trajectories. Epigenetic mechanisms respond to external signals, exert long-term effects on gene expression and have been shown in animal and cellular studies to regulate normal reproductive function, strongly implicating their role in these adaptations. Moreover, human cohort data have revealed differential DNA methylation signatures in proxy tissues that are associated with reproductive phenotypic variation, although the cause\u2013effect relationships are difficult to discern, calling for additional complementary approaches to establish functionality. In this Review, we summarize how adult reproductive function can be shaped by childhood events. We discuss why the influence of the childhood environment on adult reproductive function is an important consideration in understanding how reproduction is regulated and necessitates consideration by clinicians treating women with diverse life histories. The resolution of the molecular mechanisms responsible for human reproductive plasticity could also lead to new approaches for intervention by targeting these epigenetic modifications.;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-020-0370-8

Nucleosomes can also reposition spontaneously, but this process and its effect on TF binding have not been extensively studied. Here, we developed a method based on single-molecule optical tweezers to simultaneously measure nucleosome diffusion and TF binding to the same DNA molecule. We show that nucleosomes undergo confined diffusion on the DNA, and that the confinement is relieved upon incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z leading to an increase in TF binding, which then further biases nucleosome diffusion.

Here, we present a novel optical tweezers assay that allows monitoring the activity of RecBCD\u2019s individual subunits, when they are part of an intact full complex. We show that RecBCD and its subunits are able to generate forces up to 25\u201340 pN without a significant effect on their velocity. Moreover, the isolated RecD translocates fast but is a weak helicase with limited processivity. Experiments at a broad range of [ATP] and forces suggest that RecD unwinds DNA as a Brownian ratchet, rectified by ATP binding, and that the presence of the other subunits shifts the ratchet equilibrium towards the post-translocation state;https://elifesciences.org/articles/40836
sergei-rudnizky-bb770a68;6;;Frontiers in Endocrinology;27-02-2018;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the expression of multiple genes in the pituitary gonadotropes, most notably to induce synthesis of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but also to ensure the appropriate functioning of these cells at the center of the mammalian reproductive endocrine axis. Aside from the activation of gene-specific transcription factors, GnRH stimulates through its membrane-bound receptor, alterations in the chromatin that facilitate transcription of its target genes. These include changes in the histone and DNA modifications, nucleosome positioning, and chromatin packaging at the regulatory regions of each gene. The requirements for each of these events vary according to the DNA sequence which determines the basal chromatin packaging at the regulatory regions. Despite considerable progress in this field in recent years, we are only beginning to understand some of the complexities involved in the role and regulation of this chromatin structure, including new modifications, extensive cross talk, histone variants, and the actions of distal enhancers and non-coding RNAs. This short review aims to integrate the latest findings on GnRH-induced alterations in the chromatin of its target genes, which indicate multiple and diverse actions. Understanding these processes is illuminating not only in the context of the activation of these hormones during the reproductive life span but may also reveal how aberrant epigenetic regulation of these genes leads to sub-fertility;https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00058
sergei-rudnizky-bb770a68;7;01;Nucleic Acids Research;14-12-2017;Most functional transcription factor (TF) binding sites deviate from their \u2018consensus\u2019 recognition motif, although their sites and flanking sequences are often conserved across species. Here, we used single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers to study how Egr-1, a TF harboring three zinc fingers (ZF1, ZF2 and ZF3), is modulated by the sequence and context of its functional sites in the Lhb gene promoter. We find that both the core 9 bp bound to Egr-1 in each of the sites, and the base pairs flanking them, modulate the affinity and structure of the protein\u2013DNA complex. The effect of the flanking sequences is asymmetric, with a stronger effect for the sequence flanking ZF3. Characterization of the dissociation time of Egr-1 revealed that a local, mechanical perturbation of the interactions of ZF3 destabilizes the complex more effectively than a perturbation of the ZF1 interactions. Our results reveal a novel role for ZF3 in the interaction of Egr-1 with other proteins and the DNA, providing insight on the regulation of Lhb and other genes by Egr-1. Moreover, our findings reveal the potential of small changes in DNA sequence to alter transcriptional regulation, and may shed light on the organization of regulatory elements at promoters;https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1252
sergei-rudnizky-bb770a68;8;01-03-01;Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC);21-10-2017;Pituitary gonadotropin hormones are regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) via MAPK signaling pathways which stimulate gene transcription of the common \u03b1-subunit (Cga) and the hormone-specific \u03b2-subunits of gonadotropin. We have reported previously that GnRH-induced activities at these genes include various histone modifications, but we did not examine histone phosphorylation. This modification adds a negative charge to residues of the histone tails that interact with the negatively charged DNA, is associated with closed chromatin during mitosis, but is increased at certain genes for transcriptional activation. Thus, the functions of this modification are unclear. We initially hypothesized that GnRH might induce phosphorylation of Ser-10 in histone 3 (H3S10p) as part of its regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, possibly involving cross-talk with H3K9 acetylation. We found that GnRH increases the levels of both modifications around the Cga gene transcriptional start site (TSS) and that JNK inhibition dramatically reduces H3S10p levels. However, this modification had only a minor effect on Cga expression and no effect on H3K9ac. GnRH also increased H3S28p and H3K27ac levels and also those of activated mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 inhibition dramatically reduced H3S28p levels in untreated and GnRH-treated cells and also affected H3K27ac levels. Although not affecting basal Cga expression, MSK1/2 inhibition prevented GnRH activation of Cga expression. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that GnRH-activated MSK1 targets the first nucleosome just downstream from the TSS. Given that the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at this well-positioned nucleosome, GnRH-induced H3S28p, possibly in association with H3K27ac, would facilitate the progression of RNAPII;http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2017/10/20/jbc.M117.797845.abstract

Our results indicate that reverse transcriptase functions as a Brownian ratchet, with dNTP binding as the rectifying reaction of the ratchet. We also found that reverse transcriptase is a relatively passive enzyme, able to polymerize on structured templates by exploiting their thermal breathing.

Recent studies have revealed that the nucleosome's spontaneous, thermally driven positional dynamics are modulated by different factors, and exploited by the cell as a regulatory mechanism. In particular, enrichment of mobile nucleosomes at the promoters of genes suggests that the mobility of nucleosomes may affect the ability of transcription factors to bind DNA. However, a quantitative model describing the effect nucleosome mobility on the effective affinity of transcription factors is lacking. We present here a simple equilibrium model that captures the essence of the effect, and show that modulation of the nucleosome's mobility can be a potent and versatile regulator of transcription factor binding.;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/12/187815

Abundant pauses are modulated by the strength of the DNA duplex \u223c8 bp ahead, indicating the existence of uncharacterized RT/DNA interactions, and correspond to backtracking of the enzyme, whose recovery is also modulated by the duplex strength. Dissociation and reinitiation events, which induce long periods of inactivity and are likely the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the genome in vivo, are modulated by the template structure and the viral nucleocapsid protein.

Our understanding of the role of the nucleosome's spontaneous, thermally driven position changes in modulating expression is lacking. This is the result of the paucity of experimental data on these dynamics, at high-resolution, and for DNA sequences that belong to real, transcribed genes. We have developed an assay that uses partial, reversible unzipping of nucleosomes with optical tweezers to repeatedly probe a nucleosome's position over time. Using the nucleosomes at the promoters of two model genes, Cga and Lhb, we show that the mobility of nucleosomes is modulated by the sequence of DNA and by the use of alternative histone variants, and describe how the mobility can affect transcription, at the initiation and elongation phases;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.3159/full

Yet, the contribution of DNA sequence, histone post-translational modifications, histone variant usage and other factors in shaping the architecture of chromatin, and the mechanisms by which this architecture modulates expression of specific genes are not yet completely understood. Here we use optical tweezers to study the roles that DNA sequence and the histone variant H2A.Z have in shaping the chromatin landscape at the promoters of two model genes, Cga and Lhb. Guided by MNase mapping of the promoters of these genes, we reconstitute nucleosomes that mimic those located near the transcriptional start site and immediately downstream (+1), and measure the forces required to disrupt these nucleosomes, and their mobility along the DNA sequence. Our results indicate that these genes are basally regulated by two distinct strategies, making use of H2A.Z to modulate separate phases of transcription, and highlight how DNA sequence, alternative histone variants and remodelling machinery act synergistically to modulate gene expression.;http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12958

sergei-rudnizky-bb770a68;15;03-01;Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS);25-03-2015;Much of the mammalian genome recently was shown to be transcribed to long noncoding RNAs, one class of which is the enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) whose levels largely correlate with the mRNA levels of the target gene but whose functions are not yet clear. We examined the eRNA produced from a functional enhancer that directs cell-specific expression of the gonadotropin hormone \u03b1-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha, in the pituitary. We show that this eRNA plays a crucial role in facilitating DNA looping between the enhancer and promoter and directs histone modifications that are essential for transcription initiation and without which the chromatin becomes repressive to transcription. In this way, the eRNA mediates the function of the enhancer in directing basal gene expression;http://www.pnas.org/content/112/14/4369.full.pdf

We use a complex Ambiguity Function matrix as a pre-processing step, following which, a waveform classification, or adaptation to unlabeled reference target domains, is performed. We test our method on a wide range of tasks, datasets, and different signal distributions. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art performance on classification problems on multi-encoding, multi-feature datasets, in diverse and challenging conditions. Our novel approach to an unlabeled Radar waveform adaptation reveals impressive classification improvements to domain shifted unlabeled signals.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8958242
pavel-itkin-0525453b;2;2013;IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine;03-05-2017;"Complementary pulse pair is a radar waveform that achieves the ultimate range sidelobe reduction zero sidelobe. It is an early and simple embodiment of radar waveform diversity (WD), presently a popular topic. However, the use of complementary pulse waveforms is not widely spread because of several drawbacks. The main problem is the sensitivity to Doppler shift. Usually the two complementary coded pulses are separated in time. Doppler shift causes a phase ramp as function of time. That ramp causes two problems: (a) the two pulses in a pair are centered on different average phases; (b) there is a phase ramp during each pulse. Problem (a) also known as slow-time mismatch, is handled by the pulse-topulse conventional Doppler processing, which provides slow-time phase compensation. Problem (b) requires fast-time compensation, not provided by a simple linear Doppler processor. It causes loss of the ideal delay-sidelobe cancellation resulting in near range-sidelobes. Those near sidelobes increase with longer codes and with higher Doppler shifts. At the same time a complementary pulse pair also causes a difficulty at low Doppler shifts.";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7901728

Some of these methods routinely used in practice, at the same time as the other methods are not suitable for a business reality.

On the other hand, the rules of the market remain true.

The simulation focuses on the propagation of visible and near-infrared light in biological tissues. This research has mainly two findings: (1) the transition can be described, as was found experimentally, with good accuracy by only two terms (ballistic and diffusive). (2) The model can be utilized for cases where the absorption coefficient is not negligible compared to the scattering coefficient by adding a power-law prefactor to the diffusive term.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.21.6.066004

The paper demonstrates it on two classes of pressure vessels: Baseline configurations of a domed cylinder and a simple torus that evolve through repeated design-and-analysis cycles.

Weight savings of ~26%% are obtained with a \u201cpeanut\u201d shaped vessel compared to its domed cylindrical counterpart, and ~63%% for an asymmetrical torus compared to the symmetrical baseline, both while keeping the internal volume, pressure and allowable stress the same.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2018.02.103

liron-gibbs-bar-ph-d-14426a91;1;;Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. (ATVB);25-08-2016;OBJECTIVE: As they travel through the blood stream, plasma lipoproteins interact continuously with endothelial cells (ECs). Although the focus of research has mostly been guided by the importance of lipoproteins as risk factors for atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and other cardiovascular diseases, little is known about the mechanisms linking lipoproteins and angiogenesis under physiological conditions, and particularly, during embryonic development. In this work, we performed global mRNA expression profiling of endothelial cells from hypo-, and hyperlipidemic zebrafish embryos with the goal of uncovering novel mediators of lipoprotein signaling in the endothelium.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Microarray analysis was conducted on fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated fli1:EGFP(+) ECs from normal, hypo-, and hyperlipidemic zebrafish embryos. We found that opposed levels of apoprotein B lipoproteins result in differential expression of the secreted enzyme autotaxin in ECs, which in turn affects EC sprouting and angiogenesis. We further demonstrate that the effects of autotaxin in vivo are mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-a well-known autotaxin activity product-and that LPA and LPA receptors participate as well in the response of ECs to lipoprotein levels.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first in vivo gene expression profiling of ECs facing different levels of plasma apoprotein B lipoproteins and uncover a novel lipoprotein-autotaxin-LPA axis as regulator of EC behavior. These results highlight new roles for lipoproteins as signaling molecules, which are independent of their canonical function as cholesterol transporters.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562917
liron-gibbs-bar-ph-d-14426a91;2;04;Elife;01-10-2015;"Sleep has been conserved throughout evolution; however, the molecular and neuronal mechanisms of sleep are largely unknown. The hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons regulate sleep\\wake states, feeding, stress, and reward. To elucidate the mechanism that enables these various functions and to identify sleep regulators, we combined fluorescence cell sorting and RNA-seq in hcrt:EGFP zebrafish. Dozens of Hcrt-neuron-specific transcripts were identified and comprehensive high-resolution imaging revealed gene-specific localization in all or subsets of Hcrt neurons. Clusters of Hcrt-neuron-specific genes are predicted to be regulated by shared transcription factors. These findings show that Hcrt neurons are heterogeneous and that integrative molecular mechanisms orchestrate their diverse functions. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kcnh4a, which is expressed in all Hcrt neurons, was silenced by the CRISPR-mediated gene inactivation system. The mutant kcnh4a (kcnh4a(-/-)) larvae showed reduced sleep time and consolidation, specifically during the night, suggesting that Kcnh4a regulates sleep.";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26426478

liron-gibbs-bar-ph-d-14426a91;4;01;Nat. Med;18-06-2012;Despite the clear major contribution of hyperlipidemia to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the developed world, the direct effects of lipoproteins on endothelial cells have remained obscure and are under debate. Here we report a previously uncharacterized mechanism of vessel growth modulation by lipoprotein availability. Using a genetic screen for vascular defects in zebrafish, we initially identified a mutation, stalactite (stl), in the gene encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (mtp), which is involved in the biosynthesis of apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins. By manipulating lipoprotein concentrations in zebrafish, we found that ApoB negatively regulates angiogenesis and that it is the ApoB protein particle, rather than lipid moieties within ApoB-containing lipoproteins, that is primarily responsible for this effect. Mechanistically, we identified downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), which acts as a decoy receptor for VEGF, as a key mediator of the endothelial response to lipoproteins, and we observed VEGFR1 downregulation in hyperlipidemic mice. These findings may open new avenues for the treatment of lipoprotein-related vascular disorders.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22581286
liron-gibbs-bar-ph-d-14426a91;5;;Nucleic Acids Res;01-04-2012;The brain is a large and complex network of neurons. Specific neuronal connectivity is thought to be based on the combinatorial expression of the 52 protocadherins (Pcdh) membrane adhesion proteins, whereby each neuron expresses only a specific subset. Pcdh genes are arranged in tandem, in a cluster of three families: Pcdh\u03b1, Pcdh\u03b2 and Pcdh\u03b3. The expression of each Pcdh gene is regulated by a promoter that has a regulatory conserved sequence element (CSE), common to all 52 genes. The mechanism and factors controlling individual Pcdh gene expression are currently unknown. Here we show that the promoter of each Pcdh gene contains a gene-specific conserved control region, termed specific sequence element (SSE), located adjacent and upstream to the CSE and activates transcription together with the CSE. We purified the complex that specifically binds the SSE-CSE region and identified the CCTC binding-factor (CTCF) as a key molecule that binds and activates Pcdh promoters. Our findings point to CTCF as a factor essential for Pcdh expression and probably governing neuronal connectivity;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210889
liron-gibbs-bar-ph-d-14426a91;6;03;Dev. Cell;20-07-2010;aspases are executioners of apoptosis but also participate in a variety of vital cellular processes. Here, we identified Soti, an inhibitor of the Cullin-3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex required for caspase activation during Drosophila spermatid terminal differentiation (individualization). We further provide evidence that the giant inhibitor of apoptosis-like protein dBruce is a target for the Cullin-3-based complex, and that Soti competes with dBruce for binding to Klhl10, the E3 substrate recruitment subunit. We then demonstrate that Soti is expressed in a subcellular gradient within spermatids and in turn promotes proper formation of a similar dBruce gradient. Consequently, caspase activation occurs in an inverse graded fashion, such that the regions of the developing spermatid that are the last to individualize experience the lowest levels of activated caspases. These findings elucidate how the spatial regulation of caspase activation can permit caspase-dependent differentiation while preventing full-blown apoptosis.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643358

stylianos-tsopanidis-48205712b;1;;Engineering Fracture Mechanics;07-04-2020;The science of fractography revolves around the correlation between topographic characteristics of the fracture surface and the mechanisms and external conditions leading to their creation. While being a topic of investigation for centuries, it has remained mostly qualitative to date. A quantitative analysis of fracture surfaces is of prime interest for both the scientific community and the industrial sector, bearing the potential for improved understanding on the mechanisms controlling the fracture process and at the same time assessing the reliability of computational models currently being used for material design. With new advances in the field of image analysis, and specifically with machine learning tools becoming more accessible and reliable, it is now feasible to automate the process of extracting meaningful information from fracture surface images. Here, we propose a method of identifying and quantifying the relative appearance of intergranular and transgranular fracture events from scanning electron microscope images. The newly proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network algorithm for semantic segmentation. The proposed method is extensively tested and evaluated against two ceramic material systems (Al2O3,MgAl2O4) and shows high prediction accuracy, despite being trained on only one material system (MgAl2O4). While here attention is focused on brittle fracture characteristics, the method can be easily extended to account for other fracture morphologies, such as dimples, fatigue striations, etc.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013794419315401

The study constitutes scanning of literature articles related to stability data of OPVs, reported until mid-2015 and collecting the reported data into a database. A generic lifetime marker is utilized for rating the stability of various reported devices. The collected data is combined with an earlier developed and reported database, which was based on articles reported until mid-2013. The extended database is utilized for establishing the baselines of lifetime for OPVs tested under different conditions. The work also provides the recent progress in stability of unencapsulated OPVs with different architectures, as well as presents the updated diagram of the reported record lifetimes of OPVs.

It arises when new items are added to the inventory and the system cannot model them properly since it relies solely on historical users'\u200b feedback (e.g., ratings). Much work has been devoted to mitigate this problem mostly by employing hybrid approaches that combine content-based recommendation techniques or by devoting a portion of the user traffic for exploration to gather feedback from random users.We focus on pure CF recommender systems (i.e., without content or context information) in a realistic online setting,where random exploration is inefficient and smart exploration that carefully selects users is crucial due to the huge flux of new items with short lifespan.Moreover, users arrive randomly one after the other and the system has to immediately decide whether the arriving user will participate in the exploration of the new items.For this setting we present ExcUseMe, a smart exploration algorithm that selects a predefined number of users for exploring new items. ExcUseMe gradually excavates the users that are more likely to be interested in the new items and estimates the new items' model from their feedbacks. We evaluated ExcUseMe on several datasets and scenarios and compared it to state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results indicate that ExcUseMe is an efficient algorithm that outperforms all other algorithms on all scenarios.;null

Mothers also reported on the child\u2019sexposure to political violence and other traumatic events, posttraumatic symptoms, andthe Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The results indicate the severe consequences ofliving in the face of ongoing traumatic stress. Children and mothers from the continuousexposure sample had more posttraumatic distress and their children had higherbehavior problem scores compared with those in the past exposure sample, supportingthe allostatic load hypothesis that cumulative stress exacts a heavier toll. Because themother\u2013 child relationship is challenged in situations of exposure to violence, wecompared relational trauma (measured by co-occurrence of posttraumatic distress inboth mother and child) and found, as hypothesized, that relational trauma was moreprevalent in the Continuous sample than in the Past sample.;null

alexander-rubinstein-6789955a;1;;Nanotechnology 27 (2016), 415703;06-09-2016;Abstract.  The rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology has raised many fundamental questions that significantly impede progress in these fields. In particular, understanding the physicochemical processes at the interface in aqueous solvents requires the development and application of efficient and accurate methods. In the present work we evaluate the electrostatic contribution to the energy of model protein\u2013ceramic complex formation in an aqueous solvent. We apply a non-local (NL) electrostatic approach that accounts for the effects of the short-range structure of the solvent on the electrostatic interactions of the interfacial systems. In thisapproach the aqueous solvent is considered as a non-ionic liquid, with the rigid and stronglycorrelated dipoles of the water molecules. We have found that an ordered interfacial aqueoussolvent layer at the protein\u2013 and ceramic\u2013solvent interfaces reduces the charging energy of boththe ceramic and the protein in the solvent, and significantly increases the electrostaticcontribution to their association into a complex. This contribution in the presented NL approachwas found to be significantly shifted with respect to the classical model at any dielectric constantvalue of the ceramics. This implies a significant increase of the adsorption energy in the protein\u2013ceramic complex formation for any ceramic material. We show that for several biocompatibleceramics (for example HfO2, ZrO2, and Ta2O5) the above effect predicts electrostatically inducedprotein\u2013ceramic complex formation. However, in the framework of the classical continuumelectrostatic model (the aqueous solvent as a uniform dielectric medium with a high dielectricconstant \u223c80) the above ceramics cannot be considered as suitable for electrostatically inducedcomplex formation. Our results also show that the protein\u2013ceramic electrostatic interactions canbe strong enough to compensate for the unfavorable desolvation effect .;null

We constructed an atomistic model of the ZrO2 nano-hillock of 3-fold symmetry based on Atom Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy images. First principle quantum mechanical calculations show a substantial variation of electrostatic potential at the hillock due to the presence of surface features such as edges and vertexes. Using an implemented Monte Carlo simulated annealing method, we found the orientation of the immobilized protein on the ZrO2 surface and the contribution of the amino acid residues from the protein sequence to the adsorption energy. Accounting for the variation of the dielectric permittivity at the protein\u2013implant interface, we used a model distance-dependent dielectric function to describe the inter-atom electrostatic interactions in the adsorption potential. We found that the initial immobilization of the rigid protein fragment on the nanostructured pyramidal ZrO2 surface is achieved with a magnitude of adsorption energy larger than that of the protein on the smooth (atomically flat) surface. The strong attractive electrostatic interactions are a major contributing factor in the enhanced adsorption at the nanostructured surface. In the case of adsorption on the flat, uncharged surface this factor is negligible. We show that the best electrostatic and steric fit of the protein to the inorganic surface corresponds to a minimum of the adsorption energy determined by the non-covalent interactions.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Enhanced+initial+protein+adsorption+on+engineered+nanostructured+cubic+zirconia

The packing of the virus array was controlled systematically from rhombic packing to hexagonal packing by modulating the concentrations of poly(ethylene glycol) surfactant in thevirus solutions. The orientation and packing symmetry of the virus arrays were found to be tuned by the concentrations of surfactants in the sample solutions.

The obtained data suggest that the central Ala21-Gly29 segment of A\u03b240 can adopt folded and partially unfolded structures. At the basic pH, this segment forms folded structures stabilized by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. At the acidic pH, it forms partially unfolded structures. Two other segments flanking to the central segment exhibit the propensity to adopt unstable interconverting \u03b1-helical, 310-helical and turn-like structures. One of these segments is comprised of the Ala30-Val36 residues at both of the considered pHs. The second segment is comprised of the Glu11-Phe20 at the basic pH and of the Glu11-Val24 residues at the acidic pHs. The revealed pH-dependent structuration of the A\u03b240 allowed us to suggest a possible scenario for initial A\u03b2 aggregation. According to this scenario, the occurrence of the partially unfolded states of the Ala21-Gly29 segment plays main role in the A\u03b2 oligomerization process.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19372746

To de-convolute this problem and to evaluate the pair-wise electrostatic interaction (PEI) energies of the point charges located at the protein-solvent interface we used a non-local (NL) electrostatic approach along with a static NL dielectric response function of water. The influence of the aqueous solvent microstructure (determined by a strong non-electrostatic correlation effect between water dipoles within the orientational Debye polarization mode) on electrostatic interactions at the interface was studied in our work. It was shown that the PEI energies can be significantly higher than the energies evaluated by the classical (local) consideration, treating water molecules as belonging to the bulk solvent with a high dielectric constant. Our analysis points to the existence of a rather extended, effective low-dielectric interfacial water shell on the protein surface. The main dielectric properties of this shell (effective thickness together with distance- and orientation-dependent dielectric permittivity function) were evaluated. The dramatic role of this shell was demonstrated when estimating the protein association rate constants.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17626298
alexander-rubinstein-6789955a;8;;Biophys. J. 2004, 87, 1544-1557;01-01-2004;ABSTRACT The proper estimation of the influence of the many-body dynamic solvent icrostructure on a pairwise electrostatic interaction (PEI) at the protein-solvent interface is very important for solving many biophysical problems. In this work, the PEI energy was calculated for a system that models the interface between a protein and an aqueous solvent. The concept of nonlocal  electrostatics for interfacial electrochemical systems was used to evaluate the contribution of a solvent orientational polarization, correlated by the network of hydrogen bonds, into the PEI energy in proteins. The analytical expression for this energy was obtained in the form of Coulomb\u2019s law with an effective distance-dependent dielectric function. The asymptotic and numerical analysis carried out for this function revealed several features of dielectric heterogeneity at theprotein-solvent interface. For charges located in close proximity to this interface, the values of the dielectric function for the short-distance electrostatic interactions were found to be remarkably smaller than those determined by the classical model, in which the solvent was considered as the uniform dielectric medium of high dielectric constant. Our results have shown that taking into consideration the dynamic solvent microstructure remarkably increases the value of the PEI energy at the proteinsolvent interface.;null

J. of Hydrogen Energy;01-01-1995;AbstractThe determination of kinetic reaction rates data must be carried out under strictly controlled heat and mass transfer conditions and related to a well defined reaction controlling mechanism. A number of functions of the reacted fraction, \u03b1, designated R(\u03b1), which are characteristic of various reaction mechanisms in the solid state have been presented and successfully applied by Hancock and Sharp [J. Am. Ceram. Soc.55(2), 74 (1972)]. The integrated rate functions R(\u03b1) reflect the morphology and the geometry of the transforming phases. The functions R1(\u03b1) RSC(\u03b1) and RD(\u03b1) for the first order kinetics, phase boundary migration mechanism known as \u201cshrinking core\u201d and diffusion controlled processes, respectively, were shown to be linear in , where t0.5 is the time corresponding to \u03b1 = 0.5. In the present investigation three suitable reaction controlling mechanisms were adapted and modified by introducing a hydrogen pressure dependence function F(P). Isothermal rate measurement experiments for hydrogen absorption/desorption in the two-phase region TiFe0.8Ni0.2-TiFe0.8Ni0.2H in the temperature range 90\u2013150 \u00b0C yield temperature-dependent rate constants.

helen-brusilovsky-487b8821;1;;Journal of the International Input-Output Association;28-06-2018;The classification of imports by use and industries of destination is an important analytical economic framework. It is also a main component on the production of Input-Output tables and Supply and Use tables.The main approach presented in the literature differentiates between direct and indirect imports. For direct imports, the total value of imports for each industry is calculated using business surveys and then allocated to commodity groups through a general distribution based on imports by commodity data. The uses of indirect imports are allocated using assumptions.In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed based on assessing uses of imports for all commodities at the detailed commodity and importer level. The final product is a classification table by importer and commodity that can be updated and applied to current imports data on a monthly or yearly basis. This creates the infrastructure for the calculation of uses of imports statistics based on the weight of each importer and commodity at any given period.The uses of imports of selected commodities are assessed using administrative data. For the remaining commodities, direct imports are identified based on the importer's industry. A complementary business survey is used to identify importers that import commodities for both direct use and resale. The use and industry of destination of indirect imports is assessed via a specific survey focused on importers in the wholesale and retail trade industries.The case of Israel is presented, including specific examples of the use of administrative data and the definitions used to distinguish between direct and indirect imports.

Here we present an analytical analysis of the ICD in two coupled quantum wells (QWs) which shows that the ICD ionization of an electron is in the perpendicular direction to the semiconductor layers. This happens when two conditions are satisfied. The first condition requires the excitation of the two electrons from the valence band. The first electron is excited to the bottom of the excited subband in one quantum well, and the second to the bottom of the first subband of the adjacent QW. The second condition ensures that the distance between the wells is large enough. In our case the two QWs are far apart when the distance between the two QWs is larger than 80 \u00c5. Only vertical currents are expected in such a case. These conditions can be verified by future experiments.;https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.045310
liron-gantz-ab5092a5;7;;Applied Physics Letters;11-01-2016;We report on the generation of single-photon pulse trains at a repetition rate of up to 1\u2009GHz. We achieve this speed by modulating the external voltage applied on an electrically contacted quantum dot microlens, which is optically excited by a continuous-wave laser. By modulating the photoluminescence of the quantum dot microlens using a square-wave voltage, single-photon emission is triggered with a response time as short as (281\u2009\u00b1\u200919)\u2009ps, being 6 times faster than the radiative lifetime of (1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02)\u2009ns. This large reduction in the characteristic emission time is enabled by a rapid capacitive gating of emission from the quantum dot, which is placed in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n-junction biased below the onset of electroluminescence. Here, since our circuit acts as a rectifying differentiator, the rising edge of the applied voltage pulses triggers the emission of single photons from the optically excited quantum dot. The non-classical nature of the photon pulse train generated at GHz-speed is proven by intensity autocorrelation measurements with g(2)(0)\u2009=\u20090.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1.

liron-gantz-ab5092a5;9;;Phys. Rev. B;29-04-2015;Interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) is a relaxation process induced by electronic correlation. In this work we study the ICD process in a two coupled quantum wells (QWs) nanostructure.We study a simple one-dimensional effective potential using experimental parameters of the semiconductor QW layers, i.e., using the single-band effective-mass approximation. In our calculations we consider the discontinuity of the effective mass of the electron in each of the QW layers. We control the ICD lifetime by changing the distance between the two wells. The expected overall trend is a decrease of ICD lifetime with a decrease in the distance between the wells. We show that the distance can be tuned such that the emitted ICD electron is trapped in a metastable state in the continuum,i.e., a one-electron resonance state. This causes the lifetime of the ICD to be an order of magnitude smaller even at very long distances, and improves the efficiency of the ICD process. For the ICD to be the dominant decay mechanism it must prevail over all other possible competitive decay processes. We have found that the lifetime of the ICD is on the time scale of picoseconds. Therefore, based on our results we can design an experiment that will observe the ICD phenomenon in QWs nanostructure. This work can lead to a design of a wavelength-sensitive detector which is efficient even at low intensities.;http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.165312

Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs was demonstrated using the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade. One obvious way to increase the number of quantum correlated photons that the QDs emit is to use higher-order multiexcitons, in particular, the triexciton.

A statistical analysis of spectroscopic data reveals, that the AR-coating improves the light out-coupling of respective microlenses by a factor of 1.57 \u00b1 0.71, in quantitative agreement with numerical calculations. Taking the enhancement factor into account, we predict improved out-coupling of light with a PEE of up to 50%%.

amit-diei-988bb0186;1;;SoCS 2019 conference;16-07-2019;Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of moving a set of agents from their individual start locations to their individual goal locations, without collisions. This problem has practical applications in video games, traffic control, robotics, and more. In MAPF we assume that agents occupy one location each time step. However, in real life, some agents have different size or shape. Hence, a standard MAPF solution may be not suited in practice for some applications. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm, based on the CBS algorithm, that finds a plan for moving a set of train-agents, i.e., agents that occupy a sequence of two or more locations, such as trains, buses, planes, or even snakes. We prove that our solution is optimal and show experimentally that indeed such a solution can be found. Finally, we explain how our solution can also apply to agents with any geometric shape.;https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS19/paper/viewFile/18394/17508

It becomes even more imperative to improve overlay performance in order to maintain the roadmap for advance integrated circuit manufacturing. One of the critical factors in 20nm manufacturing is the overlay performance between the Middle of Line (MOL) and the Poly layer. The margin between these two layers was a process limiter, it was essential that we maintain a very tight overlay control between these layers. Due to various process and metrology related effects, maintaining good overlay control became a challenge. In this paper we describe the various factors affecting overlay performance and the measures taken to mitigate or eliminate said factors to improve overlay performance.;https://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2046598
anna-golotsvan-14443a5b;2;;SPIE;01-04-2014;As leading edge lithography moves to advanced nodes in high-mix, high-volume manufacturing environment, automated control of critical dimension (CD) within wafer has become a requirement. Current control methods to improve CD uniformity (CDU) generally rely upon the use of field by field exposure corrections via factory automation or through scanner sub-recipe. Such CDU control methods are limited to lithography step and cannot be extended to etch step. In this paper, a new method to improve CDU at post etch step by optimizing exposure at lithography step is introduced. This new solution utilizes GLOBALFOUNDRIES\u2019 factory automation system and KLA-Tencor\u2019s K-T Analyzer as the infrastructure to calculate and feed the necessary field by field level exposure corrections back to scanner, so as to achieve the optimal CDU at post etch step. CD at post lithography and post etch steps are measured by scatterometry metrology tools respectively and are used by K-T Analyzer as the input for correction calculations. This paper will explain in detail the philosophy as well as the methodology behind this novel CDU control solution. In addition, applications and use cases will be reviewed to demonstrate the capability and potential of this solution. The feasibility of adopting this solution in high-mix, high-volume manufacturing environment will be discussed as well.;http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2045433

anna-golotsvan-14443a5b;7;;SPIE;24-03-2009;As the semiconductor industry continues to drive toward smaller design nodes, overlay error budgets will continue to shrink making metrology ever more challenging. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the need to continue to drive down costs and increase productivity, especially given the competitive and macro-economic landscape going forward. In order to satisfy these two contradicting requirements, new ways of maintaining metrology tools and recipes are needed. Traditionally, recipes are generated manually by operators or even metrology engineers, involving both tool time and engineering resources. Furthermore, the influence of individual skill levels can lead to undesirable variations and is a potential source of errors that could result in yield loss. By means of automatic recipe generation both engineering and capital equipment resources can be minimized. Implementation of an automated recipe creation process will also result in improved recipe integrity. In this study, we show a methodology of a highly automated recipe generation for overlay measurements. We will outline the benefits of such an implementation and comment on the value for all segments of the semiconductor industry as well as provide data from production fabs demonstrating these capabilities and benefits.;null
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;1;;PloS one;14-12-2017;Collinear facilitation of contrast sensitivity supported by lateral interactions within primary visual cortex is implicated in contour and object perception, with neural correlates in several frequency bands. Although higher component of the ERP power spectrum, the gamma-band, is postulated to reflect object representation, attention and memory, its neuronal source has been questioned, suggesting it is an artifact reflecting saccadic eye movements. Here we explored the gamma-band activity during collinear facilitation with no saccade-related confounds. We used single-trial spectral analysis of ERP in occipital channels in a time-window of nearly complete saccadic suppression and discarded sporadic trials containing saccades, in order to avoid saccadic artifacts. Although converging evidence suggests that gamma-band oscillations emerge from local excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance involving GABAergic inhibition, here we show activity amplification during facilitatory collinear interactions, presumably dominated by excitations, in the gamma-band 150\u2013350 milliseconds following onset of low near-threshold contrast stimulus. This result highlights the potential role of gamma-band oscillations in neuronal encoding of basic processes in visual perception. Thus, our findings suggest that gamma-band ERP spectrum analysis may serve as a useful and reliable tool for exploring basic perception, both in normal adults and in special populations.;null
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;2;;Vision Research;24-11-2017;Israeli Air Force (IAF) pilots continue flying combat missions after the symptoms of natural near-vision deterioration, termed presbyopia, begin to be noticeable. Because modern pilots rely on the displays of the aircraft control and performance instruments, near visual acuity (VA) is essential in the cockpit. We aimed to apply a method previously shown to improve visual performance of presbyopes, and test whether presbyopic IAF pilots can overcome the limitation imposed by presbyopia. Participants were selected by the IAF aeromedical unit as having at least initial presbyopia and trained using a structured personalized perceptual learning method (GlassesOff application), based on detecting briefly presented low-contrast Gabor stimuli, under the conditions of spatial and temporal constraints, from a distance of 40\u202fcm. Our results show that despite their initial visual advantage over age-matched peers, training resulted in robust improvements in various basic visual functions, including static and temporal VA, stereoacuity, spatial crowding, contrast sensitivity and contrast discrimination. Moreover, improvements generalized to higher-level tasks, such as sentence reading and aerial photography interpretation (specifically designed to reflect IAF pilots' expertise in analyzing noisy low-contrast input). In concert with earlier suggestions, gains in visual processing speed are plausible to account, at least partially, for the observed training-induced improvements.;null

Training consisted of detecting briefly presented Gabor stimuli under spatial and temporal masking conditions. Consistent with previous findings, perceptual learning induced a significant improvement in near VA and reading speed under conditions of limited exposure duration. Our results show that the improvements in VA and reading speed observed following perceptual learning are closely linked to the initial VA, with only a minor fraction of the observed improvement that may be attributed to the additional sessions performed by those with the worse VA.";null

anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;5;;Journal of Vision;01-01-2015;Spatial crowding decreases object recognition and conscious visual perception in clutter. In a previous study we used brief presentation times to reveal the effects of a crowded presentation in the fovea. Here we aimed to test the relationships between varying visual acuity (VA) and crowding in the fovea, under the assumption that in uncorrected presbyopia, the processing is relatively normal, whereas the retinal input is blurred. We tested whether normal participants whose near VA is gradually reduced due to age-related deterioration (presbyopia, or \u201caging eye\u201d) will show an acuity-dependent increase in foveal crowding. We used brief presentations and acuity-threshold letter targets in order to magnify the crowding-effect amplitude in the fovea. A total of 195 participants with an age range of 20\u201368 years and an average of 44.3 \u00b1 11.7 years (M \u00b1 SD) were divided into four age groups, all without any optical correction for the near distance. Our findings show that crowding is proportional to VA. This proportionality is affected by VA-age dependency, with a nonlinear S-shaped pattern: A steep VA reduction begins to develop, which is compatible with the normal onset age of presbyopia symptoms and a saturation in the VA-age dependency in the oldest age group, for which we propose a VA-eccentricity account. Finally, there is a high variance in the crowding amplitude in the young, even before the onset age of presbyopia symptoms, suggesting crowding conditions with limited presentation times as a highly sensitive measure of VA, which predicts visual performance in complex tasks, such as reading.;http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2381507
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;6;;Journal of Vision;01-01-2015;"Spatial crowding impairs conscious visual perception and object recognition in clutter.Short presentation times produce crowding in the normal fovea, in young participants and in uncorrected presbyopes (\u201caging eye\u201d), measured as reduced visual acuity (VA). On the other hand, perceptual learning improves near VA in healthy young adults, in presbyopia, and in amblyopia. Here we aimed at exploring the effects of perceptual training on crowded VA in uncorrected presbyopes with naturally decreased VA, with two specific objectives: (a) to objectively measure crowded VA, taking advantage of the natural deterioration of near visual acuity from being normal or better than normal (i.e., 20/20 or better) in young participants to naturally decreasing in uncorrected presbyopes; and (b) to explore whether perceptual training previously shown to improve visual functions as complex as reading will affect crowded VA. Visual acuity was measured under crowded and uncrowded conditions by having subjects identify letters presented for short durations ranging from 34 to 116 msec. Training consisted of detecting brief Gabor stimuli under spatial and temporal masking conditions, using the GlassesOff mobile application (GlassesOff, Inc., New York, NY)on iOS devices from a distance of 40 cm. Before training, a robust reduction in crowded VA was found in the fovea of presbyopes. Training resulted in significant improvement of letter identification under both crowded and uncrowded VA conditions for all stimulus durations. After training, the crowded condition threshold reached the level of the uncrowded threshold measured before training. Thus, training enabled the subjects to overcome the effect of reduced VA under the crowded condition. We suggest that more efficient spatial and temporal processing induced by perceptual learning allows one to improve crowded VA, including that found on naturally reduced near VA.";http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2293654
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;7;;Vision Research;01-01-2014;Oculomotor behavior and parameters are known to be affected by the allocation of attention and could potentially be used to investigate attention disorders. We explored the oculomotor markers of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that are involuntary and quantitative and that could be used to reveal the core-affected mechanisms, as well as be used for differential diagnosis. We recorded eye movements in a group of 22 ADHD-diagnosed patients with and without medication (methylphenidate) and in 22 control observers while performing the test of variables of attention (t.o.v.a.). We found that the average microsaccade and blink rates were higher in the ADHD group, especially in the time interval around stimulus onset. These rates increased monotonically over session time for both groups, but with significantly faster increments in the unmedicated ADHD group. With medication, the level and time course of the microsaccade rate were fully normalized to the control level, regardless of the time interval within trials. In contrast, the pupil diameter decreased over time within sessions and significantly increased above the control level with medication. We interpreted the suppression of microsaccades and eye blinks around the stimulus onset as reflecting a temporal anticipation mechanism for the transient allocation of attention, and their overall rates as inversely reflecting the level of arousal. We suggest that ADHD subjects fail to maintain sufficient levels of arousal during a simple and prolonged task, which limits their ability to dynamically allocate attention while anticipating visual stimuli. This impairment normalizes with medication and its oculomotor quantification could potentially be used for differential diagnosis.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698914001187
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;8;;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;01-01-2014;There is growing experimental evidence that the engagement of different brain areas in a given motor task may change with practice, although the specific brain activity patterns underlying different stages of learning, as defined by kinematic or dynamic performance indices, are not well understood. Here we studied the change in activation in motor areas during practice on sequences of handwriting-like trajectories, connecting four target points on a digitizing table \u201cas rapidly and as accurately as possible\u201d while lying inside an fMRI scanner. Analysis of the subjects' pooled kinematic and imaging data, acquired at the beginning, middle, and end of the training period, revealed no correlation between the amount of activation in the contralateral M1, PM (dorsal and ventral), supplementary motor area (SMA), preSMA, and Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) and the amount of practice per-se. Single trial analysis has revealed that the correlation between the amount of activation in the contralateral M1 and trial mean velocity was partially modulated by performance gains related effects, such as increased hand motion smoothness. Furthermore, it was found that the amount of activation in the contralateral preSMA increased when subjects shifted from generating straight point-to-point trajectories to their spatiotemporal concatenation into a smooth, curved trajectory. Altogether, our results indicate that the amount of activation in the contralateral M1, PMd, and preSMA during the learning of movement sequences is correlated with performance gains and that high level motion features (e.g., motion smoothness) may modulate, or even mask correlations between activity changes and low-level motion attributes (e.g., trial mean velocity).;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00201/abstract
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;9;;Nature's Scientific Reports;01-01-2012;Presbyopia, from the Greek for aging eye, is, like death and taxes, inevitable. Presbyopia causes near vision to degrade with age, affecting virtually everyone over the age of 50. Presbyopia has multiple negative effects on the quality of vision and the quality of life, due to limitations on daily activities \u2013 in particular, reading. In addition presbyopia results in reduced near visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, and slower processing speed. Currently available solutions, such as optical corrections, are not ideal for all daily activities. Here we show that perceptual learning (repeated practice on a demanding visual task) results in improved visual performance in presbyopes, enabling them to overcome and/or delay some of the disabilities imposed by the aging eye. This improvement was achieved without changing the optical characteristics of the eye. The results suggest that the aging brain retains enough plasticity to overcome the natural biological deterioration with age.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3284862/
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;10;;Vision Research;01-01-2011;Our recent neurophysiological findings provided evidence for collinear facilitation in detecting low-contrast Gabor patches (GPs) and for the abolishment of these collinear interactions by backward masking (BM) (Sterkin et al., 2008b and Sterkin et al., 2009a). We suggested that the suppression induced by the BM eliminates the collinear facilitation. Moreover, our recent study showed that training on a BM task overcomes the BM effect, hence, improves the processing speed (Polat, 2009). Here we applied training on detecting a target that is followed by BM in order to study whether reinforced facilitatory interactions can overcome the suppressive effects induced by BM. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded before and after ten training sessions performed on different days. Before training, BM induced suppression of target detection, at the ISI of 50 ms, in agreement with earlier behavioral findings. This ISI coincides with the active time-window of lateral interactions. After training, our results show a remarkable improvement in all behavioral measurements, including percent of correct responses, sensitivity (d\u2019), reaction time (RT) and the decision criterion for this ISI. The ERP results show that before training, BM attenuated the physiological markers of facilitation at the same ISI of 50 ms, measured as the amplitude of the negative N1 peak (latency of 260 ms). After the training, the shorter latency (by 20 ms, latency of 240 ms) and the increased amplitude of N1 represent the development of faster and stronger facilitatory lateral interactions between the target and the collinear flankers. Moreover, a high-amplitude late peak (P4, latency of 610\u2013630 ms) was not affected by training, however its high correlation with RT (95%%) before training was significantly decreased (to 76%%), consistent with a lower-level representation of a trained skill. We suggest that perceptual learning that strengthens collinear facilitation results in a faster processing speed.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698911003634
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;11;;Vision Research;01-01-2010;The visual system can adapt to optical blur, whereby the adapted image is perceived as sharp. Here we show that adaptation reduces blur-induced biases in shape perception, with repeated adaptations (perceptual learning), leading to unbiased perception upon re-exposure to blur. Observers wore a cylindrical lens of +1.00 D on one eye, thus simulating monocular astigmatism. The other eye was either masked with a translucent blurred lens (monocular) or unmasked (dichoptic). Adaptation was tested in several repeated sessions with a proximity-grouping task, using horizontally or vertically arranged dot-arrays, without feedback, before, after, and throughout the adaptation period. A robust bias in global-orientation judgment was observed with the lens, in accordance with the blur axes. After the observer wore the lens for 2 h, there was no significant change in the bias, but after 4 h, the monocular condition, but not the dichoptic, resulted in reduced bias. The adaptation effect of the monocular 4-h adaptation was preserved, and even improved, when the lens was re-applied the next day, indicating learning. After-effects were observed under all experimental conditions except for the 4-h monocular condition, where learning took place. We suggest that, with long experience, adaptation is transferred to a long-term memory that can be instantly engaged when blur is re-applied, or disengaged when blur is removed, thus leaving no after-effects. The comparison between the monocular and dichoptic conditions indicates a binocular cortical site of plasticity.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269891000235X
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;12;;Vision Research;01-01-2009;Perceptual facilitation in detecting low-contrast Gabor patches (GPs) is induced by collinearly oriented high-contrast flankers. Our recent Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) study provided new physiological evidence for these collinear interactions, reflected by nonlinear modulation of multiple waveform components and frequencies [Sterkin, A., Yehezkel, O., Bonneh, Y. S., Norcia, A., & Polat, U. (2008). Multi-component correlate for lateral collinear interactions in the human visual cortex. Vision Research, 48(15), 1641\u20131647]. Here we used VEPs to study the temporal structure of this process. Low-contrast, foveal target GP (T) was simultaneously flanked by two collinear high-contrast GPs with a spatial separation that induces facilitation of T (lateral masking, LM). Another mask, identical to LM, was presented at different time-intervals (ISIs) after LM (backward masking, BM-on-LM). The responses were compared to separate waveforms evoked by T-alone and mask-alone at different ISIs. BM canceled the physiological markers of facilitation at an ISI of 50 ms, in agreement with earlier psychophysical findings, whereas no BM effect on T-alone was observed. This ISI coincides with the active time\u2013window of lateral interactions, confirming our working model. The waveform amplitude of the negative N1 peak of LM was modulated toward the linear prediction of no interactions and the spectrum was shifted toward suppression, with no evidence of facilitation. Moreover, the P1 peak amplitude of BM was decreased at the same ISI, indicating that there is a mutual interference in cortical representation of both events. Waveform subtraction between BM-on-LM and LM suggests a mechanism of extended persistence of the target representation underlying facilitation in LM. We suggest an explanation for the role of improved detection of collinear stimuli in grouping of contours.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698909001606
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;13;;Vision Research;01-01-2008;Perceptual facilitation, a decrease in detection threshold for low-contrast Gabor patches (GPs) occurs when the GP is flanked by collinearly oriented high-contrast patches. There is earlier evidence suggesting a spatial architecture of excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Here we used Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) to study the temporal structure of this process. We measured VEPs elicited by a foveal near-threshold target GP presented in isolation (T), T in the presence of two flanking collinear high-contrast GPs (lateral masking, LM), or the flankers alone (F). Stimuli were presented for 50 ms every 1000 ms. The choice of the set parameters elicited behavioral facilitation of T detection. Significant modulation of peak amplitudes in LM compared with linearly summed waveforms elicited by T and F was found for five alternating polarity components, ranging from 65 to 290 ms after stimulus onset. In the frequency domain, suppression at lower frequencies (up to 0.8 log units) was followed by facilitation at higher frequencies (4\u20136 Hz, up to 0.8 log units). Although no differences in the latencies were found, lateral interactions were reflected by non-linear waveform modulation of multiple components and frequencies, including components as early as 65\u201375 ms. Spectrum analysis suggests that both suppression and facilitation may be found for the same configuration of stimuli, simultaneously, distributed at different temporal frequencies and/or sources. The physiological correlates of lateral interactions may thus originate at multiple sources, only some of which are explicitly facilitatory. The final perceptual outcome of this complex spatio-temporal representation is determined by combining sensory and cognitive factors.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908002186
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;14;;Journal of Vision;01-01-2008;"Detection of low-contrast Gabor patches (GPs) is improved when flanked by collinear GPs, whereas suppression is observed for high-contrast GPs. The facilitation resembles the principles of Gestalt theory of perceptual organization. We propose a model for contour integration in the context of noise that incorporates a temporal element into this spatial architecture. The basic principles are (1) the response increases with increasing contrast, whereas the latency decreases; (2) activity-dependent interactions: facilitation for low and suppression for high activity; (3) the variance increases with contrast for responses, rates, and latency; and (4) inhibition has a shorter time constant than excitation. When a texture of randomly oriented GPs is presented, the response to every element decreases due to fast inhibition between the neighboring elements, shifting the activity toward the range of collinear facilitation. Next, the slower excitation induces selective facilitation along the contour elements. Consequently, the response to the contour increases, whereas the variance of the rate and latency decreases, providing better temporal correlation between the contour elements. Thus, collinear facilitation increases the saliency of contours. Our model may suggest a solution to the binding problem by bridging between the temporal and spatial aspects of lateral interactions that determine the encoding of perceptual grouping.";http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193604
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;15;;Advances in Cognitive Psychology;01-01-2007;Temporal masking is a paradigm that is widely used to study visual information processing. When a mask is presented, typically within less than 100 msec before or after the target, the response to the target is reduced. The results of our psychophysical and visual evoked potential (VEP) experiments show that the masking effect critically depends on a combination of several factors: (1) the processing time of the target, (2) the order of presentation of the target and the mask, and (3) the spatial arrangement of the target and the mask. Thus, the masking effect depends on the spatial-temporal combination of these factors. Suppression was observed when the mask was positioned within a spatial range that was found to evoke inhibition, and when the temporal separation between the target and the mask was short. In contrast, lateral facilitation was observed when the mask was presented at a spatial separation that did not evoke inhibition from the target's vicinity and with a temporal sequence that preceded the target, or when it was presented simultaneously with it, but not when the target preceded the mask. We propose that masking effects, either suppression or facilitation, reflect integration into the spatial and the temporal domains of the feedforward response to the target and the lateral inputs evoked by the mask (excitatory and/or inhibitory). Because the excitation evoked by the mask develops and propagates slowly from the mask's location to the target's location, it lags behind the response to the target. On the other hand, inhibition that is produced in the vicinity of the target evolves more rapidly and follows the onset and offset of the stimulus more closely. Thus, lateral excitation that overcomes the inhibition may facilitate the grouping of local elements into a global percept by increasing the survivability of the object and its accessibility for perceptual awareness.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864984/
anna-sterkin-3ab0302b;16;02-01;Journal of Neuroscience;01-01-2005;Cortical maps and feedback connections are ubiquitous features of the visual cerebral cortex. The role of the feedback connections, however, is unclear. This study was aimed at revealing possible organizational relationships between the feedback projections from area V2 and the functional maps of orientation and retinotopy in area V1. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals was combined with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and connectional anatomy in owl monkeys. Tracer injections were administered at orientation-selective domains in regions of pale and thick cytochrome oxidase stripes adjacent to the border between these stripes. The feedback projections from V2 were found to be more diffuse than the intrinsic horizontal connections within V1, but they nevertheless demonstrated clustering. The clusters of feedback axons projected preferentially to interblob cytochrome oxidase regions. The distribution of preferred orientations of the recipient domains in V1 was broad but appeared biased toward values similar to the preferred orientation of the projecting cells in V2. The global spatial distribution of the feedback projections in V1 was anisotropic. The major axis of anisotropy was systematically parallel to a retinotopic axis in V1 corresponding to the preferred orientation of the cells of origin in V2. We conclude that the feedback connections from V2 to V1 might play a role in enhancing the response in V1 to collinear contour elements.;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/8/2117.full

An important condition for the emergence of a crack-like behavior is the existence of stress drops in frictional rupture, whose basic physical origin has been recently elucidated. Here we show that for generic and realistic frictional constitutive relations, and once the necessary conditions for the emergence of an effective crack-like behavior are met, frictional rupture dynamics are approximately described by a crack-like, fracture mechanics energy balance equation. This is achieved by independently calculating the intensity of the crack-like singularity along with its associated elastic energy flux into the rupture edge region, and the frictional dissipation in the edge region. We further show that while the fracture mechanics energy balance equation provides an approximate, yet quantitative, description of frictional rupture dynamics, interesting deviations from the ordinary crack-like framework \u2014 associated with non-edge-localized dissipation \u2014 exist. Together with the recent results about the emergence of stress drops in frictional rupture, this work offers a comprehensive and basic understanding of why, how and to what extent frictional rupture might be viewed as an ordinary fracture process.

A general framework for understanding and interpreting frictional rupture commonly involves an analogy to ordinary crack propagation, with far-reaching implications for various disciplines, from engineering tribology to geophysics. An important feature of the analogy to cracks is the existence of a reduction in the stress-bearing capacity of the ruptured interface, i.e.~of a drop from the applied stress, realized far ahead of a propagating rupture, to the residual stress left behind it. Yet, how and under what conditions such finite and well-defined stress drops emerge from basic physics are not well understood. Here we show that for rapid rupture a stress drop is directly related to wave radiation from the frictional interface to the bodies surrounding it and to long-range bulk elastodynamics, and not exclusively to the physics of the contact interface. Furthermore, we show that the emergence of a stress drop is a transient effect, affected by the wave travel time in finite systems and by the decay of long-range elastic interactions. Finally, we supplement our results for rapid rupture with predictions for slow rupture. All of the theoretical predictions are supported by available experimental data and by extensive computations. Our findings elucidate the origin of stress drops in frictional rupture, i.e.~they offer a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of why, how and to what extent frictional rupture might be viewed as an ordinary fracture process.;https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041043

At the heart of these challenges lies the inherent coupling between the interfacial constitutive relation\u2014the macroscopic friction law\u2014and the bulk elasticity of the bodies that form the frictional interface. In this feature paper, we discuss the generic properties of a minimal macroscopic friction law and the many ways in which its coupling to bulk elasticity gives rise to rich spatiotemporal frictional dynamics. We first present the widely used rate-and-state friction constitutive framework, discuss its power and limitations, and propose extensions that are supported by experimental data. We then discuss how bulk elasticity couples different parts of the interface, and how the range and nature of this interaction are affected by the system\u2019s geometry. Finally, in light of the coupling between interfacial and bulk physics, we discuss basic phenomena in spatially extended frictional systems, including the stability of homogeneous sliding, the onset of sliding motion and a wide variety of propagating frictional modes (e.g., rupture fronts, healing fronts and slip pulses). Overall, the results presented and discussed in this feature paper highlight the inseparable roles played by interfacial and bulk physics in spatially extended frictional systems.;https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4442/7/10/91/htm

A common approach to this problem associates nucleation with an instability of an expanding creep patch upon surpassing a critical length Lc. The critical nucleation length Lc is conventionally obtained from a spring\u2010block linear stability analysis extended to interfaces separating elastically deformable bodies using model\u2010dependent fracture mechanics estimates. We propose an alternative approach in which the critical nucleation length is obtained from a related linear stability analysis of homogeneous sliding along interfaces separating elastically deformable bodies. For elastically identical half\u2010spaces and rate\u2010and\u2010state friction, the two approaches are shown to yield Lc that features the same scaling structure, but with substantially different numerical prefactors, resulting in a significantly larger Lc in our approach.

michael-aldam-ph-d-3941a836;6;;Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth;09-10-2017;Sliding along frictional interfaces separating dissimilar elastic materials is qualitatively different from sliding along interfaces separating identical materials due to the existence of an elastodynamic coupling between interfacial slip and normal stress perturbations in the former case. This bimaterial coupling has important implications for the dynamics of frictional interfaces, including their stability and rupture propagation along them. We show that while this bimaterial coupling is a monotonically increasing function of the bimaterial contrast, when it is coupled to interfacial shear stress perturbations through a friction law, various physical quantities exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the bimaterial contrast. In particular, we show that for a regularized Coulomb friction, the maximal growth rate of unstable interfacial perturbations of homogeneous sliding is a nonmonotonic function of the bimaterial contrast and provides analytic insight into the origin of this nonmonotonicity. We further show that for velocity\u2010strengthening rate\u2010and\u2010state friction, the maximal growth rate of unstable interfacial perturbations of homogeneous sliding is also a nonmonotonic function of the bimaterial contrast.

It is well known that frictional interfaces separating two dissimilar materials couple interfacial slip and normal stress variations, a coupling that has major implications on their stability, failure mechanism, and rupture directionality. In contrast, it is traditionally assumed that interfaces separating identical materials do not feature such a coupling because of symmetry considerations. We show, combining theory and experiments, that interfaces that separate bodies made of macroscopically identical materials but lack geometrical reflection symmetry generically feature such a coupling. We discuss two applications of this novel feature. First, we show that it accounts for a distinct, and previously unexplained, experimentally observed weakening effect in frictional cracks. Second, we demonstrate that it can destabilize frictional sliding, which is otherwise stable.

alexander-rysin-01b7b25;1;;IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability;01-06-2012;In this paper, the impact of resonant voltage oscillations, triggered on on-die power supply and ground grids by switching of active elements, upon electromigration (EM) and Joule heating of the interconnects, constituting the grids, has been studied. The recorded voltage waveforms inside a working microchip reveal that the voltage oscillations on these grids can locally attain amplitude that is even higher than 10%% with regard to the supply voltage. It was observed that these oscillations can appear with an opposite phase at two adjacent power grid areas, thus giving rise to strong currents. These experimentally measured waveforms have been taken as a basis for our calculations. The results reveal that resonant voltage oscillations on both power supply and ground grids lead to a substantial aggravation of both EM and Joule heating. Furthermore, it was found that the situation is aggravated with the growth of the voltage oscillations' frequency.;null

The signal waveforms experimentally measured at the far-end of on-die transmission lines (45 nm CMOS technology test chip) with various ratios between the level of resistive losses and the characteristic impedance of the line, have been taken as a basis for calculations of Age parameters from Berkeley Reliability Tools, and for calculations of CMOS inverters dynamic power dissipation. The results reveal that the high level of resistive losses accelerates the device degradation caused by Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) wearout mechanism and leads to increased power consumption. Therefore, the resistive losses of on-die transmission lines should be also regarded as a reliability issue.;null

The experimentally measured signal waveforms at the far end of on-die (45-nm CMOS technology ULSI test chip) interconnects with different levels of resistive losses have been taken as a basis for calculations of Age parameters (from the Berkeley reliability tools model) of MOSFETs whose inputs are supplied with these signals. The results reveal that, with the growth of resistive losses, the degradation of the MOSFETs due to hot carrier injection (HCI) wearout mechanism is accelerated and their dynamic power consumption is augmented. Furthermore, it was found that, for applications where these MOSFETs are directly loaded by the following interconnection line, the electromigration and Joule heating of this line are aggravated (independently of the level of losses in the line), and degradation of MOSFETs (connected to the far end of the line) due to HCI is accelerated as well. Therefore, the interconnects' resistive losses are a serious reliability issue and should be taken into account in corresponding reliability models.

tali-yarnitzky-69499090;1;;Molecular diversity;01-10-2016;Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) plays an important role in a broad range of intracellular regulatory mechanisms and in the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including microbial and viral infections, cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, several potent PKR inhibitors have been synthesized. However, the enzyme's multifunctional character and a multitude of PKR downstream targets have prevented the successful transformation of such inhibitors into effective drugs. Thus, the need for additional PKR inhibitors remains. With the help of computer-aided drug-discovery tools, we designed and synthesized potential PKR inhibitors. Indeed, two compounds were found to inhibit recombinant PKR in pharmacologically relevant concentrations. One compound, 6-amino-3-methyl-2-oxo-N-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-1-carboxamide, also showed anti-apoptotic properties. The novel molecules diversify the existing pool of PKR inhibitors and provide a basis for the future development of compounds based on PKR signal transduction mechanism.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27480630

tali-yarnitzky-69499090;3;;ACS chemical biology;21-11-2014;The mammalian odorant receptors (ORs) form a chemical-detecting interface between the atmosphere and the nervous system. This large gene family is composed of hundreds of membrane proteins predicted to form as many unique small molecule binding niches within their G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) framework, but very little is known about the molecular recognition strategies they use to bind and discriminate between small molecule odorants. Using rationally designed synthetic analogs of a typical aliphatic aldehyde, we report evidence that among the ORs showing specificity for the aldehyde functional group, a significant percentage detect the aldehyde through its ability to react with water to form a 1,1-geminal (gem)-diol. Evidence is presented indicating that the rat OR-I7, an often-studied and modeled OR known to require the aldehyde function of octanal for activation, is likely one of the gem-diol activated receptors. A homology model based on an activated GPCR X-ray structure provides a structural hypothesis for activation of OR-I7 by the gem-diol of octanal.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181321
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;4;;PloS one;01-01-2011;"BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION: The Prokineticin receptor (PKR) 1 and 2 subtypes are novel members of family A GPCRs, which exhibit an unusually high degree of sequence similarity. Prokineticins (PKs), their cognate ligands, are small secreted proteins of \u223c80 amino acids; however, non-peptidic low-molecular weight antagonists have also been identified. PKs and their receptors play important roles under various physiological conditions such as maintaining circadian rhythm and pain perception, as well as regulating angiogenesis and modulating immunity. Identifying binding sites for known antagonists and for additional potential binders will facilitate studying and regulating these novel receptors. Blocking PKRs may serve as a therapeutic tool for various diseases, including acute pain, inflammation and cancer.METHODS AND RESULTS: Ligand-based pharmacophore models were derived from known antagonists, and virtual screening performed on the DrugBank dataset identified potential human PKR (hPKR) ligands with novel scaffolds. Interestingly, these included several HIV protease inhibitors for which endothelial cell dysfunction is a documented side effect. Our results suggest that the side effects might be due to inhibition of the PKR signaling pathway. Docking of known binders to a 3D homology model of hPKR1 is in agreement with the well-established canonical TM-bundle binding site of family A GPCRs. Furthermore, the docking results highlight residues that may form specific contacts with the ligands. These contacts provide structural explanation for the importance of several chemical features that were obtained from the structure-activity analysis of known binders. With the exception of a single loop residue that might be perused in the future for obtaining subtype-specific regulation, the results suggest an identical TM-bundle binding site for hPKR1 and hPKR2. In addition, analysis of the intracellular regions highlights variable regions that may provide subtype specificity.";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22132188

Recently determined GPCR structures provide opportunities for advancements in GPCR modeling. This review focuses on the choice of experimental templates, the treatment of extracellular loops and the description of ligand-binding sites in GPCR modeling. Four important conclusions are reached in this review: (i) multi-template models may produce better structures than single-template models, although inferior models may also be generated by multi-template approaches, warranting the development and application of improved model assessment methods; (ii) cautious incorporation of knowledge-based constraints can improve the quality of models and docking; (iii) molecular dynamics simulations account for structural features not observed in X-ray structures and may refine docking poses; and (iv) while progress in de novo methods for long loop prediction is ongoing, loopless models provide a practical alternative for docking and virtual screening applications.";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20443165
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;6;53;Molecular systems biology;01-01-2006;Understanding the dynamics and variability of protein circuitry requires accurate measurements in living cells as well as theoretical models. To address this, we employed one of the best-studied protein circuits in human cells, the negative feedback loop between the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene Mdm2. We measured the dynamics of fluorescently tagged p53 and Mdm2 over several days in individual living cells. We found that isogenic cells in the same environment behaved in highly variable ways following DNA-damaging gamma irradiation: some cells showed undamped oscillations for at least 3 days (more than 10 peaks). The amplitude of the oscillations was much more variable than the period. Sister cells continued to oscillate in a correlated way after cell division, but lost correlation after about 11 h on average. Other cells showed low-frequency fluctuations that did not resemble oscillations. We also analyzed different families of mathematical models of the system, including a novel checkpoint mechanism. The models point to the possible source of the variability in the oscillations: low-frequency noise in protein production rates, rather than noise in other parameters such as degradation rates. This study provides a view of the extensive variability of the behavior of a protein circuit in living human cells, both from cell to cell and in the same cell over time.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16773083
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;7;01-03-03;Blood;15-09-2003;The G-protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family mediate pro-angiogenic activities, such as endothelial cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and vessel morphogenesis. We synthesized and tested the effects of a 9-amino acid peptide (KRX-725), derived from the second intracellular loop of S1P3 (EDG3). KRX-725 mimics the effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the natural ligand of S1P3, by triggering a Gi-dependent MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signal transduction pathway. Using aortic rings as an ex vivo model of angiogenesis, vascular sprouting was assessed in the presence of KRX-725 or S1P. KRX-725 induced extensive and dense vascular sprouts, which contain an elaborated organization of endothelial and smooth muscle layers, including lumen formation. When KRX-725 or S1P was combined with proangiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stem cell factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor, the effect was synergistic, leading to further enhancement of vascular sprouting. KRX-725 also initiated neovascularization in a mouse corneal pocket assay in vivo and showed synergism with bFGF. The specificity of KRX-725 was demonstrated via peptide-induced receptor internalization of S1P3 but not S1P1. The ability of a short peptide to stimulate extensive angiogenesis and to synergize with pro-angiogenic factors suggests that KRX-725 may serve as a useful agent in treating pathologic conditions such as peripheral vascular disease, cardiac ischemia, or tissue grafts.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12763936
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;8;;Genes & development;15-01-1999;The presence of a single EGF receptor in Drosophila is contrasted by multiple ligands activating it. This work explores the role of two ligands, Spitz and Vein, in the embryonic ventral ectoderm. Spitz is a potent ligand, whereas Vein is an intrinsically weak activating ligand. We show that secreted Spitz emanating from the midline, triggers expression of vein in the ventral-most cell rows, by inducing expression of the ETS domain transcription factor Pointed P1. In the absence of Vein, lateral cell fates are not induced when Spitz levels are compromised. The positive feedback loop of Vein generates a robust mechanism for patterning the ventral ectoderm.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9925640
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;9;;Mechanisms of development;01-12-1998;Activation of the Drosophila EGF-receptor (DER) is spatially and temporally controlled by the release of its various ligands. DER and its ligand Spitz mediate the formation of specific somatic muscle precursors. We show that a second DER ligand, Vein, complements the activity of Spitz in the development of various somatic muscle precursors. In vn mutant embryos, the DER-dependent muscle precursors do not form in some of the segments. This phenotype is significantly enhanced in embryos carrying only one copy of wild type spitz. Our analysis suggests that Vein activation of DER differs qualitatively from that of Spitz in that it does not lead to the expression of the inhibitory protein Argos, possibly leading to a continuous activation of the DER signaling pathway.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10349622
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;10;;Genes & development;15-10-1997;Inductive interactions between cells of distinct fates underlie the basis for morphogenesis and organogenesis across species. In the Drosophila embryo, somatic myotubes form specific interactions with their epidermal muscle attachment (EMA) cells. The establishment of these interactions is a first step toward further differentiation of the EMA cells into elongated tendon cells containing an organized array of microtubules and microfilaments. Here we show that the molecular signal for terminal differentiation of tendon cells is the secreted Drosophila neuregulin-like growth factor Vein produced by the myotubes. Although vein mRNA is produced by all of the myotubes, Vein protein is secreted and accumulates specifically at the muscle-tendon cell junctional site. In loss-of-function vein mutant embryos, muscle-dependent differentiation of tendon cells, measured by the level of expression of specific markers (Delilah and beta1 tubulin) is blocked. When Vein is expressed in ectopic ectodermal cells, it induces the ectopic expression of these genes. Our results favor the possibility that the Drosophila EGF receptor DER/Egfr expressed by the EMA cells functions as a receptor for Vein. We show that Vein/Egfr binding activates the Ras pathway in the EMA cells leading to the transcription of the tendon-specific genes, stripe, delilah, and beta1 tubulin. In Egfr1F26 mutant embryos that lack functional Egfr expression, the levels of Delilah and beta1 tubulin are very low. In addition, the ability of ectopic Vein to induce the expression of Delilah and beta1 tubulin depends on the presence of functional Egfrs. Finally, activation of the Egfr signaling pathway by either ectopically secreted Spitz, or activated Ras, leads to the ectopic expression of Delilah. These results suggest that inductive interactions between myotubes and their epidermal muscle attachment cells are initiated by the binding of Vein, to the Egfr on the surface of EMA cells.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9334331
tali-yarnitzky-69499090;11;;Developmental biology;01-06-1995;"Laminin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, has been implicated in a wide array of biological activities. Its specific roles during development, however, remain to be elucidated. In this report we describe the specific contribution of laminin to histogenesis and organogenesis during Drosophila embryogenesis. In particular, the function of laminin during mesoderm development and morphogenesis was dissected by analyzing embryos deficient in laminin A chain alone or in both laminin A and B2 chains. We show that laminin function is not required for the early phases of mesoderm patterning and morphogenesis in embryos at the extended germ band phase (stage 11). However, laminin function is required for the proper morphogenesis of the heart, somatic mesoderm, and the gut during later stages of embryonic development. In laminin A-deficient embryos, the heart is \""broken\"" as a result of dissociation of the pericardial cells. The somatic myotubes are defective and do not extend properly, and the ventral oblique muscles never reach their proper attachment sites. Finally, during midgut formation, the endoderm fails to undergo the initial columnar polarization in the absence of functional laminin.

The user interactively draws freehand shapes, either in the plane or in space over arbitrary freeform surface(s) and the system automatically reconstructs a plausible result, a new freeform curve or surface.  Several intuitive direct modeling operations are offered that a casual or novice user is likely to find easy to use.  As we consider Boolean operations counter-intuitive for novice users, a direct modeling scheme of complex freeform geometry of similar power is proposed as an alternative.  Once a curve is sketched on a surface it can be further manipulated on the same surface.  That is, scaled, translated, rotated, etc.  Further, a sketched curve can be employed directly to create a hole (cut) in the geometry and/or to sweep a handle out of (into the) geometry.  The entire framework allows the modeling of complex freeform geometry in an intuitive manner, all while avoiding Booleans.;http://www.cadanda.com/TOCV6No2.html

The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) types among women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2-3) and CC.Materials and methods: We conducted a nested cohort study of patients diagnosed with CIN 2-3 or CC. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of CIN 2-3 or CC and HPV-DNA testing from the cervix.Results: During the study period, we collected clinical data on 608 women of whom 402 were with CIN 2-3 and 206 with diagnosis of CC. When examining 14 high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) types, patients with CIN 2-3, 90.3%% were found positive to at least one type of HR-HPV, 89.8%% from CC patients were found positive to at least one type of HR-HPV. A total of 4.5%% of patients with CIN 2-3 and 3.9%% of those with CC were positive to only one LR-HPV or to some of a few LR-HPV types. Among 5.2%% with CIN 2-3 and 6.3%% of those with CC, no HPV types were detected.Conclusions: The prevalence of the LR-HPV in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cervical lesions is low but is expected to increase in the future because of the expected decrease in CC caused by HPV types that are included in the bi-, quadri-, and nanovalent vaccine. The CIN 2-3 and CC patients with LR-HPV types and with negative HPV, challenge HPV screening sensitivity, which is based on a limited number of HR-HPV types.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;7;;Gynecol Obstet Invest;01-01-2019;Background: The yield of adjuvant radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients with intermediate risk factors is controversial. The objective of our meta-analysis was to shed light on this important issue.Material and methods: Search was conducted in several databases. By independent screening of titles and abstracts, 2 investigators selected original researches examining the effect of adjuvant radiation treatment on overall survival and progression-free survival in cervical cancer patients with intermediate risk factors.Results: Of the 5 articles included, a total of 591 patients with intermediate risk factors were encompassed. Statistical significance was noted in favor of radiation therapy in a subgroup of patients with 2 or more intermediate factors in terms of recurrence (OR 0.46 [95%% CI 0.28-0.74, p = 0.001]) and overall survival (OR 1.86 [95%% CI 1.03-3.36, p = 0.04]). After adding patients with one risk factor, radiation exerted a non-significant effect on recurrence rate, overall survival, disease-free survival, and 5-year cancer-specific survival, while increasing the rate of gastrointestinal side effects (2.4 vs. 0%%, p = 0.0156).Conclusions: Adjuvant radiation therapy decreases the risk for recurrence and increases the overall survival in patients with 2 intermediate risk factors. These benefits were not shown after adding patients with one risk factor.;null

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of forced coughing as a pain-reducing technique during cervical punch biopsy compared to a control group.Materials and methods: The study was a prospective randomised-control trial. The study group comprised 90 women who underwent cervical punch biopsies during investigation of abnormal Pap test results. The women were randomly assigned to 'cough' and control groups. Pain was measured on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) during different stages of the procedure.Results: VAS pain score during biopsies was significantly lower in the 'cough' group. The median pain level in the 'cough' group was 1.5, compared to 4.0 in the control group. Eighty percent of the women in the 'cough' group reported a pain level of 2.0 or less compared to 40%% of the women in the 'control' group (P = 0.0002). In the second biopsy, 69%% of the women reported VAS \u2264 2.0 in the cough group compared to 28%% of the patients in the control group. Forced coughing was shown both to reduce anxiety regarding the prospect of future cervical procedures and to decrease patients' desires for future pain management. This was true for 32%% of the women in the 'control' group compared to 12%% of the women in the 'cough' group (P = 0.05).Conclusion: Forced coughing provides significant pain relief during cervical punch biopsy and reduces the patients' fears and desires for pain medications in future procedures.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;9;125;Int J Gynecol Cancer .;01-09-2018;Objectives: Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is a highly aggressive subtype of endometrial carcinoma. Histopathologically, it resembles the pattern of serous papillary carcinoma of the ovary. Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is the most widely used biomarker in epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Its use in UPSC evaluation has yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of preoperative serum CA-125 as a prognostic factor in patients with UPSC.Methods: The study cohort included all women with UPSC operated in our institution between January 2002 and June 2016. All patients underwent complete surgical staging. Preoperative CA-125 was reviewed and correlated with clinical and pathological parameters.Results: Sixty-one women met the study criteria. Median preoperative CA-125 was found to be significantly associated with disease stage. Patients with disease stages I to IV had median preoperative CA-125 levels of 12.15, 19.6, 22.6, and 177.5 U/mL (P < 0.0001) respectively. Levels of CA-125 were significantly associated with positive cytology (P < 0.0001), omental disease (P < 0.0001), pelvic or para-aortic lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001), and adnexal involvement (P < 0.0001). The optimal cutoff that provided the best sensitivity and specificity for omental and parametrial involvement as well as positive cytology was 57.5 U/mL. For adnexal and lymph node involvement, the optimal cutoff value was 41.8 U/mL.Conclusions: In patients with UPSC, preoperative CA-125 level correlates with known prognostic parameters of endometrial carcinoma and is associated with extrauterine involvement. These data should stimulate the need for further evaluation of the role of CA-125 in predicting recurrence and survival in UPSC.;null

Data supporting a survival advantage of endometrial cancer diagnosed prior to the onset of postmenopausal bleeding are lacking.Objective: To compare the survival of asymptomatic and bleeding postmenopausal patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer.Study design: This was an Israeli Gynecology Oncology Group retrospective multicenter study of 1607 postmenopausal patients with endometrial cancer: 233 asymptomatic patients and 1374 presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. Clinical, pathological, and survival measures were compared.Results: There was no significant difference between the asymptomatic and the postmenopausal bleeding groups in the proportion of patients in stage II-IV (23.5%% vs 23.8%%; P = .9) or in high-grade histology (41.0%% vs 38.4%%; P = .12). Among patients with stage-I tumors, asymptomatic patients had a greater proportion than postmenopausal bleeding patients of stage IA (82.1%% vs 66.2%%; P < .01) and a smaller proportion received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (30.5%% vs 40.6%%; P = .02). There was no difference between asymptomatic and postmenopausal bleeding patients in the 5-year recurrence-free survival (79.1%% vs 79.4%%; P = .85), disease-specific survival (83.2%% vs 82.2%%; P = .57), or overall survival (79.7%% vs 76.8%%; P = .37).Conclusion: Endometrial cancer diagnosed in asymptomatic postmenopausal women is not associated with higher survival rates. Operative hysteroscopy/curettage procedures in asymptomatic patients with ultrasonographically diagnosed endometrial polyps or thick endometrium are rarely indicated. It is reasonable to reserve these procedures for patients whose ultrasonographic findings demonstrate significant change over time.";null

Data were collected from the medical records, and patient and tumor characteristics and disease outcomes were compared between BRCA mutation carriers and noncarriers. The primary outcome was overall survival.Results: In total, 14 BRCA mutation carriers and 50 noncarriers were included. Both groups had similar treatment modalities (P=0.530). A non-significant trend toward BRCA mutation carriers being diagnosed more frequently at an advanced stage compared with noncarriers was observed (P=0.090). Median overall survival (25 vs 37 months; P=0.442), progression-free survival (37 vs 29 months; P=0.536), and disease-specific survival (60 vs 39 months; P=0.316) were similar between the carrier and noncarrier groups.Conclusions: Although not significant, BRCA mutation carriers tended to have more advanced disease at diagnosis. However, the survival was similar irrespective of the BRCA status in this small group.

yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;12;01;Minerva Ginecol;01-06-2018;Background: The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is one of the treatments for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1). One of the risks of LEEP is preterm birth. We evaluated final pathological diagnoses following LEEP as treatment for CIN1 lesions, for procedures in which cone height was determined by patients' age.Methods: A retrospective study of 329 women diagnosed with CIN1 on a cervical biopsy and treated by LEEP. In patients under age 35 years, a thin LEEP COIN was performed, and in women over 35 years, a regular LEEP was performed.Results: The final pathological diagnosis was CIN2 and CIN3 in 14.6%% of the women. The average excision height was 0.64 cm in women aged under 35 years, 0.82 cm in women aged 36-45 years, and 0.96 cm in women older than 46 (P<0.0001). Comparing excision height less than 0.8 cm to excision height above 0.9 cm, complications of the procedure, positive margins rates and recurrence rates were similar.Conclusions: Among women of childbearing age, the performance of a LEEP procedure with smaller cone height appeared equivocal in achieving correct pathological diagnoses and low recurrence. To avoid increasing the risk of premature delivery, the excisional depth should be adjusted to age and fertility status.;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29845824/

yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;14;;J Low Genit Tract Dis .;01-10-2017;"Objectives: In cervical cancer, a number of pathological parameters have been explored for their utility in tailoring a less aggressive approach for patients with low-risk early stage disease. We examined whether, in patients with cervical cancer stage IA1 to IB1, diagnosed by loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), clearance of hrHPV after LLETZ correlates with absence of residual disease at the final pathology after definitive or further surgery.Materials and methods: Data were collected from patients diagnosed with early stage invasive cervical cancer and positive hrHPV DNA, who had a repeat cervical HPV test 3 to 12 weeks after LLETZ and before final surgical treatment. We compared characteristics of patients with post-LLETZ negative and positive hrHPV.Results: Of 28 patients, 13 were post-LLETZ negative hrHPV; of these, 11 did not have residual cancer in the final pathological specimen; two patients had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3. Of the 15 women who had post-LLETZ positive hrHPV, 10 had residual cancer in the final pathological specimen and 3 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ; only 2 were negative for cancer. The post-LLETZ hrHPV test shows a sensitivity of 86.7%% and specificity of 84.6%%.Conclusions: Clearance of hrHPV from the cervix after LLETZ was found to correlate with the absence of residual cancer in the final surgical specimen. Testing for hrHPV post-LLETZ might serve as a new parameter for risk assessment and tailoring of a less radical operation in women with early stage cervical cancer.";null

yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;16;02-03;Minerva Ginecol .;01-06-2017;Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is classified as a biologic carcinogen causing cervical cancer. Our aim was to identify all the HPV types responsible for cervical cancer and pre-cervical cancer in Israel.Methods: This study included 226 women, diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3 and 115 women diagnosed with cervical cancer, and tested for all HPV typing during the period of January 2006 to May 2013.Results: HPV was detected in 92.9%% of women with CIN 2-3 and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was detected in 85.8%% of them. In women with cervical cancer, HPV was positive in 96.5%%, HR-HPV detected in 93%%. In the CIN 2-3 group the most common HPV types were 16 (42%%), 31 (8.8%%) and 18 (4.9%%) and in the cancer group HPV 16 (57.4%%), 45 (9.6%%), and 18 (7.8%%). Multiple HPV types were seen in 12.8%% of CIN 2-3 group but only in 0.9%% of cancer group. The chief complaint led to cancer diagnosis was post menopause bleeding (27%%), while abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test lead to CIN 2-3 diagnosis in 75.2%% of the women. Only 22.6%% of women diagnosed with cancer were diagnosed due to abnormal Pap test and 76.9%% of them were diagnosed at stage I, as compared to women diagnosed with cancer because of bleeding or abnormal mass, of them 57.1 %% were diagnosed at stage I (P<0.07).Conclusions: HR-HPV types were found in 93%% of cancer group and 85.8%% of CIN 2-3 group, and low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) was detected in 3.5%% and 7.1%% of women with cervical cancer and CIN 2-3 respectively. The most common HPV types in cervical cancer women were 16, 45 and 18. Women diagnosed with cancer because abnormal Pap test were in earlier stage compared to women diagnosed because of complains. Including LR-HPV types in screening HPV can increase the sensitivity of the test.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;17;01-02-819-19;Arch Gynecol Obstet;01-03-2017;Background: H19 is a paternally imprinted, oncofetal gene expressed in various embryonic tissues and in 85%% of the ovarian tumors. H19-DTA (BC-819) is a DNA plasmid that drives the expression of the diphtheria toxin gene under the regulation of the H19 promoter sequence and therefore is a potential treatment for various tumors that overexpress the H19 gene, among them-ovarian cancer.Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of intra-peritoneal (IP) instillations of H19-DTA (BC-819) plasmid in treating ovarian/peritoneal cancer patients with advanced recurrent disease.Methods: A phase 1-2A multi-centric trial included 14 eligible patients who were either platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant with positive H19 expression. Patients were treated IP with escalating weekly doses of BC-819 for a maximum of 6-9 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were assessed after the first course of treatment for each patient and each subsequent cohort was enrolled once each subject had completed the first course of treatment and its 4-week follow-up period. The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and response to treatment were assessed after the induction course and then periodically.Results: During the study, no DLTs were observed. Only 5 grade 1 and 2 AEs, which occurred in 4 patients were considered as possibly related to BC-819. The best tumor response seen was stable disease. Median survivals of 3.2, 5.3 and 6.5 months were observed for the 60, 120 and 240 mg cohorts, respectively.Conclusions: BC-819 can be considered safe and well tolerated in intraperitoneal doses up to 240 mg. Hybridization of intraperitoneal chemotherapy with the biological treatment of BC-819 should be further evaluated in phase 2 and 3 studies.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;18;;Isr Med Assoc J .;01-03-2017;Background: Tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist within the breast tissue. In the uterus, tamoxifen is an agonist for some estrogen receptors and therefore can cause hyperplasia or neoplasia in the endometrium.Objectives: To compare characteristics of patients with uterine sarcoma who were and were not previously treated with tamoxifen.Methods: The medical records of all women with uterine sarcoma who had been treated at the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, Israel, during 2000-2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Disease characteristics, histological type of sarcoma, patient demographics, treatments and final outcomes were compared between patients who had and those who had not been exposed to tamoxifen.Results: Of the 66 patients identified, 14 (21%%) had been exposed to tamoxifen, one of them for 3 years and 13 for at least 5 years. Mean ages were 69 \u00b1 8 and 66 \u00b1 12 years for those exposed and those not exposed to the drug, respectively. Rates of uterine carcinosarcoma were 86%% (12/14) and 44%% (23/52), respectively (P < 0.006). Patients with carcinosarcoma were older than other sarcoma patients (73 \u00b1 7 vs. 59 \u00b1 11 P < 0.005).There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in rates of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia or heart disease. The mean time from diagnosis to death was 7.37 \u00b1 0.42 years. The overall survival rates of carcinosarcoma patients were not statistically different from that of other sarcoma patients. Tamoxifen exposure was not associated with overall survival among all sarcoma patients, nor among the subgroup of carcinosarcoma patients.Conclusions: Tamoxifen treatment was associated with elevated incidence of carcinosarcoma among women with uterine sarcoma, but was not found to be associated with prognosis or with co-morbidities.;null

Our aim was to compare perioperative and obstetric outcomes associated with laparoscopic and open appendectomy in a large contemporary cohort of pregnant women.Methods: Retrospective review of all women who underwent appendectomy during pregnancy in a single hospital during 2000-2014.Results: Ninety-two patients met the study criteria. Fifty (54%%) underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and 42 (46%%) open appendectomy. The laparoscopy group had a lower median gestational age at surgery (16 weeks versus 24 weeks, P < .001), a shorter median hospital stay (5 days versus 3 days, P < .001), and a lower rate of postoperative complications (8%% versus 24%%, P = .04). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of gestational age at delivery, Apgar scores, preterm delivery, and fetal loss.Conclusions: Laparoscopic appendectomy during pregnancy is safe and associated with better surgical outcomes than open appendectomy, with no difference in obstetric outcomes.;null

yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;21;;Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol;01-11-2016;Objectives: Infected pelvic hematoma is a relatively common complication of vaginal hysterectomy, manifesting with postoperative pain and fever which often necessitate surgical drainage. We aimed to assess the effect of the surgical technique for vaginal cuff closure on the incidence of this complication.Study design: Until March 31, 2010, our surgical protocol for vaginal hysterectomy included complete vaginal cuff closure. After this date, all surgeries were performed using another technique, by which a patent tract was left at the vaginal cuff for drainage of blood, secretions and debris. We reviewed medical records of all women who underwent vaginal hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse in our institution between January 2006 and November 2015, including demographic, clinical and surgical data. We compared the incidence of postoperative infected pelvic hematomas before and after March 31, 2010.Results: We identified 325 women who underwent vaginal hysterectomy during the first time period (group I) and 243 women who underwent this procedure during the second time period (group II). While demographic and clinical data were not significantly different between the two groups, the incidence of infected pelvic hematomas necessitating hospitalization was significantly lower in group II (3.8%% vs. 13.5%%, p<0.0001).Conclusions: A significant reduction in the incidence of infected pelvic hematoma following vaginal hysterectomy was noted using a surgical technique that allows for drainage of blood and debris through the vaginal cuff.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;22;;Int J Surg .;01-10-2016;"Background: Ultrasonography is frequently used to diagnose acute appendicitis in women of reproductive age, but its diagnostic value in pregnant patients remains unclear. This study sought to compare the diagnostic performance of ultrasound in pregnant and young nonpregnant women with suspected acute appendicitis.Methods: The database of a single tertiary medical center was reviewed for all women of reproductive age who underwent appendectomy either during pregnancy (2000-2014) or in the nonpregnant state (2004-2007) following ultrasound evaluation. The performance of ultrasound in terms of predicting the final pathologic diagnosis was compared between the pregnant and non pregnant groups using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results: Of 586 young women treated for appendicitis during the study periods (92 pregnant, 494 non-pregnant), 200 underwent preoperative ultrasound [67 pregnant, and 133 nonpregnant young women]. The pregnant and nonpregnant groups were comparable in age and presenting symptoms. There was no significant difference in the predictive performance of ultrasound between the two groups (AUC 0.76 and 0.73 respectively, p = 0.78) or within the pregnant group, by trimester [first (n = 23), AUC 0.73; second (n = 32), AUC 0.67; third (n = 12), AUC 0.86; p = 0.4]. Ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 0.94 in the pregnant group and 0.91 in the nonpregnant group; corresponding negative predictive values were 0.40 and 0.43.Conclusions: There appears to be no difference in the ability of ultrasound to predict the diagnosis of acute appendicitis between pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Therefore, similar preoperative imaging algorithms may be used in both patient populations.";null

HPV was found in 60%% and 66.6%% of vulvar and vaginal cancer patients respectively, and in 82.3%% and 84.6%% of patients with VIN3 and VAIN3 respectively. A history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or warts was observed in 10%% and 10.5%% of vulvar and vaginal cancer patients respectively, and in 57.9%% and 46%% of patients with VIN3 and VAIN3 respectively. In 52.6%% of patients the vaginal cancer was metastases from other organs.Conclusions: Most women with vulvar carcinoma are older than 70 years. VIN3 and VAIN3 are associated with HPV infection and the most prevalent type is HPV16. Almost half the vaginal cancers are associated with metastases from other organs and almost half of VAIN3 is associated with past cervical dysplasia or carcinoma.;null

However, little is known about their relation to uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC). We evaluated several preoperative hematologic parameters and their association with clinicopathologic features, disease progression and overall survival in USPC patients.Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study reviewing charts of all patients with a histologic pure USPC at two gynecologic oncology centers from January 2000 through July 2012. All patients had comprehensive hematologic tests prior to primary surgical treatment and were exposed to the same adjuvant treatment protocol.Results: The study included 56 patients, mean age at diagnosis 69.4\u00b115. Six (11%%) had platelet count above 400000 10(6)/L, of them four (66%%) were dead at the end of follow up (HR=1.4, p=0.48; CI 95%% 0.5-4.3). The mean hemoglobin level was 12.3g/dl, fibrinogen 437.5mg/dL and lymphocytes 2013/\u03bcL. None of these parameters was significantly associated with 5 year survival. Leukocyte and neutrophil levels were adversely associated with survival. Of 15 patients with leukocytosis >10000/\u03bcL, 67%% were dead at the end of follow up (HR=3.98, p=0.003; CI 95%% 1.6-9.8).

The definite preventative treatment for these cases is early, risk-reducing, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). The aims of the study were to describe the incidence and source of early occult malignancy after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in carriers of Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA mutations and to characterize the clinical and pathological features of this unique population.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively regarding women who underwent BSO in our gynecologic oncology unit from January 2002 through July 2012, after a positive test for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.Results: The following 92 cases of BRCA mutations were included: 53 BRCA1, 37 BRCA2, and 2 with both mutations. After risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, 5 (5.4%%) of the patients were found to have early occult adnexal malignancy upon pathology study. All 5 had the BRCA1 185 del-AG mutation. Three of the 5 malignancies originated from the ovaries and 2 in the fallopian tubes with no involvement of the ovaries.Conclusions: A 5.4%% incidence of early occult malignancy in adnexal pathology of BSO was found in carriers of Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA mutations. Two cases with malignant origins within the fallopian tube, while sparing the ovaries in their entirety, support the fallopian tubes as the originating organ for some ovarian or peritoneal malignancies in BRCA mutation carriers.;null

Five sonographic parameters were evaluated: heterogeneous or complex echogenicity of the lesion, presence of a 'bright edge sign,' regular endometrial-myometrial junction, the presence of a normal endometrium adjacent to the lesion, and detection of small intralesional cysts. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of these parameters were calculated, as well as combinations of pairs of parameters.Results: Seventy-nine patients were eligible for the current study, 26 with benign endometrial polyps and 53 with stage 1 endometrial carcinoma. The sonographic appearance of numerous small intralesional cysts (cystic formation) was highly related to benign polyp; the presence of a lesion with heterogeneous echogenicity had sensitivity and specificity for malignancy of 63.5 and 88.5%%, respectively.Conclusions: We have shown that asymptomatic endometrial lesions, which are homogenous, have bright edges, and small intralesional cysts are likely to be benign Determining these parameters during sonographic evaluation can assist in identifying patients who will benefit from a follow-up strategy instead of an unnecessary surgical intervention.";null

Each bending state of the GNP-based flexible sensor gives unique nanoparticle spatial organization, altering the interaction between GNP ligands and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which increases the amount of data obtainable from each sensor. Individual dynamic flexible sensor could selectively detect parts per billion (ppb) level VOCs that are linked with ovarian cancers in exhaled breath and discriminate them from environmental VOCs that exist in exhaled breath samples, but do not relate to ovarian cancer per se. Strain-related response successfully discriminated between exhaled breath collected from control subjects and those with ovarian cancer, with data from a single sensor being sufficient to obtain 82%% accuracy, irrespective of important confounding factors, such as tobacco consumption and comorbidities. The approach raises the hope of achieving an extremely simple, inexpensive, portable, and noninvasive diagnostic procedure for cancer and other diseases.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;28;01-02;Fam Cancer;01-09-2015;BRCA mutation carriers may use tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention or treatment. Hormone replacement therapy is often prescribed after surgical menopause and oral contraceptives are recommended for ovarian cancer prevention. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of these medications and other risk factors on endometrial cancer risk in BRCA carriers. Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified from a registry of mutation carriers. Cases were 83 women who had a diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Controls were 1027 matched women who did not develop endometrial cancer and who had an intact uterus. All women completed a baseline questionnaire, which included questions about ages at menarche and menopause, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy use, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, breast cancer history and tamoxifen use. We estimated the odds ratio associated with each risk factor in a multivariate analysis. No differences were found between cases and controls in terms of age at menarche, BMI, smoking, or oral contraceptive use. In a multivariate analysis, for women taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy, the odds ratio was 0.23 (95%% CI 0.03-1.78, p = 0.16), and for women taking progesterone-only hormone replacement therapy the odds ratio was 6.91 (95%% CI 0.99-98.1, p = 0.05). The adjusted odds ratio for endometrial cancer associated with a history of tamoxifen use was 3.50 (95%% CI 1.51-8.10, p = 0.003). The observed increased risk of endometrial cancer associated with progesterone-only therapy merits further study.;null

Only a minority of patients with familial endometrial cancer have a recognized cancer syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the most common genetic syndrome associated with endometrial cancer and a marked increased risk of colon cancer. Cowden syndrome is a rare condition resulting from a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog. The risk for endometrial cancer is about five times higher in women with Cowden syndrome than in the general population. Recently, a novel germline mutation in the POLD1 gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase \u03b4 was described in several families with multiple cases of endometrial cancer. This mutation is also associated with colorectal cancer. The association between BRCA1 mutations and endometrial cancer has been investigated in several studies; it appears that the risk of endometrial cancer is restricted to women with a history of tamoxifen exposure. In recent years, research has focused on genetic polymorphisms that are associated with endometrial cancer risk. Although many polymorphisms have been identified, their clinical significance is unclear and they have not been adapted for clinical practice.";null

The goal is to leave no residual disease post-surgery; for women treated with primary debulking surgery this has been associated with an improvement in survival. It has not been shown that the survival advantage conferred by having no residual disease post-surgery is present for women who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Methods: We reviewed the records of 326 women with stage IIIc or IV serous ovarian cancer. We determined if they received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary debulking surgery and we measured the extent of residual disease post-surgery. We estimated seven-year survival rates for women after various treatments.Results: Women who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to have no residual disease than women who had primary debulking surgery (50.1%% versus 41.5%%; p=0.03) but they experienced inferior seven-year survival (8.6%% versus 41%%; p<0.0001). Among women who had primary debulking surgery, those with no residual disease had much better seven-year survival than women who had any residual disease (73.6%% versus 21.0%%; p<0.0001). Women who had no residual disease after debulking surgery and who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy had a seven-year survival of 90%%.Conclusions: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be reserved for ovarian cancer patients who are not candidates for primary debulking surgery.

Patients were divided into 3 groups (MSI-high, MSI-low, and MSI-stable) according to the National Cancer Institute criteria. We compared the prevalence of specific known risk and protective factors among the 3 subgroups, including body mass index, smoking history, parity, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, past oral contraceptive use, and tubal ligation. Similarly, we compared the distribution of the histologic subtypes among the 3 subgroups.Results: A total of 917 ovarian cancer patients were included. One hundred twenty-seven cases of cancer (13.8%%) were MSI-high. Subgroup analyses according to smoking, body mass index, parity, past oral contraceptive use, and past tubal ligation did not reveal any statistically significance differences among the groups. Among the 29 patients with BRCA1 mutations, 20.7%% had MSI-high cancers compared with 5.9%% among 17 patients with BRCA2 mutations. The proportions of different ovarian cancer histologies among the various MSI subgroups were similar.Conclusions: The prevalence of risk and protective factors among ovarian cancer patients is similar for cancers with and without MSI. The distributions of MSI do not differ significantly among ovarian cancers with different histologies. Ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations had a 21%% rate of MSI-high tumors compared with 6%% among patients with BRCA2 mutations, but this difference was not statistically significant.";null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;33;;Gynecology Oncology;01-09-2013;Purpose: The use of statins has been associated with reduced risk of malignancies in a variety of organ sites. This study was aimed at studying the effects of statins on gynecological cancers.Methods: The Cancer in The Ovary and Uterus Study (CITOUS) is a case-control study of newly diagnosed cases of gynecological malignancies and age/sex/clinic/ethnic-group matched population controls. Use of statins prior to and following diagnosis was assessed in a subset of 424 cases of ovarian and endometrial cancers and 341 controls, enrolled in Clalit Health Services (CHS), using pharmacy records.Results: The use of statins for more than one year prior to diagnosis was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer (OR=0.56, 95%% CI: 0.33-0.94) and of endometrial cancer (OR=0.59, 95%% CI: 0.40-0.87). The association with endometrial cancer, but not with ovarian cancer (OR=0.54, 0.26-1.13), remained statistically significant after adjustment for fruit and vegetable consumption, sports activity, family history of endometrial and colorectal cancer, ethnicity, BMI, duration of breast feeding, age at 1st pregnancy and use of menopausal hormones (RR=0.48, 0.26-0.89). Women who used statins only after diagnosis of cancer had a significantly better survival of both ovarian cancer (Log rank test, p=0.021, age adjusted HR=0.47, 0.26-0.85) and endometrial cancer (p=0.06, age adjusted HR=0.45, 0.23-0.87).Conclusion: The use of statins for more than one year before diagnosis was associated with a reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer and possibly ovarian cancer. A significantly improved survival of cases of both malignancies was noticed when statins were taken only after diagnosis.;null

The incidence of endometrial cancer was estimated per 100,000 women per year. The hazard ratios for endometrial cancer were estimated by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) according to age group and country of residence. We estimated the impact of tamoxifen and hormone replacement therapy on the incidence of endometrial cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.Results: After a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, we identified 17 endometrial cancers (13 cases in BRCA1 and 4 cases in BRCA2). The SIR for BRCA1 carriers was 1.91 (95%% CI: 1.06-3.19, p=0.03) and for BRCA2 carriers was 1.75 (95%% CI: 0.55-4.23, p=0.2). The SIR was 4.14 (95%% CI: 1.92 to 7.87) for women who received tamoxifen and was 1.67 (95%% CI: 0.81 to 3.07) for women who did not receive tamoxifen. The ten-year cumulative risk of endometrial cancer in women who were treated with tamoxifen was 2.0%%.Conclusions: The risk of endometrial cancer is higher in BRCA1 mutation carriers than in the general population. The excessive risk is largely attributable to a history of tamoxifen use, but the actual risk of endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen is small. It is important to discuss hysterectomy at the time of prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy if tamoxifen is to be considered.;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23562522/
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;35;;J Womens Health;01-06-2011;Previous study has shown that in the United States, most maternal deaths and severe obstetric complications due to chronic disease are potentially preventable through improved medical care before conception. Many women who need assisted reproductive technology (ART) because of infertility are older than the average pregnant woman. Risks for such chronic diseases as obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and malignancy greatly increase with maternal age. Chronic illness increases the risk of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure and is also associated with increased obstetric risk and even death. The objective of this review is to outline the potential risks for older women who undergo ART procedures and pregnancy and to characterize guidelines for evaluation before enrollment in ART programs. A PubMed search revealed that very few studies have related to pre-ART medical evaluation. Therefore, we suggest a pre-ART medical assessment, comparable to the recommendations of the American Heart Association before noncompetitive physical activity and the American Society of Anesthesiologists before elective surgery. This assessment should include a thorough medical questionnaire and medical examination. Further evaluation and treatment should follow to ensure the safety of ART procedures and of ensuing pregnancies.;null
yakir-segev-md-carmel-haifa-israel-gyn-oncology;36;;Int J Gynecol Cancer .;01-12-2010;Objective: To determine the incidence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in an enlarged series of uterine serous carcinoma (USC) patients and to determine whether patients with USC are associated with a personal or familial history of breast or ovarian carcinoma.Methods: A cohort of all consecutive patients with diagnosed USC was identified for 9 years. Family pedigrees were drawn as far back and laterally as possible. In all patients, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and analyzed for the 3 mutations common in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. All patients went through total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. Tubal, ovarian, and peritoneal carcinoma were ruled out clinically and pathologically in all patients.Results: Of 51 consecutive patients with USC in Ashkenazi Jews studied, we identified 13 patients (25.5%%) who were previously found to have breast carcinoma, 17 patients (33.3%%) who had a first-degree relative with breast or ovarian carcinoma, and 8 patients (15.7%%) who were found to be carriers of 1 of the 3 BRCA germline mutations.Conclusions: This series of USC patients, the largest consecutive series to date, suggests a higher incidence of BRCA carriers among Ashkenazi Jews as compared with the general population. This high rate of BRCA germline mutations in USC patients coupled with a high rate of personal and familial cancer histories may suggest that USC is associated with the hereditary breast-ovarian syndrome. This potential association of USC to the BRCA-associated cancer spectrum may have implications for the clinical management and intervention of unaffected BRCA1-2 germline mutation carriers. However, at the current time, there are insufficient data to provide evidence-based guidelines regarding the optimal timing or specific intervention to prevent cancers in these high-risk women.;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21119368/

All cases occurred after transvaginal hysterectomy, 25 (90%%) presented with fever, 20 (71%%) with pelvic pain and 5 (20%%) with urinary retention. All hematomas were diagnosed by ultrasound. They were located at the vaginal cuff in 18 (64%%), anterior vaginal wall in six (21%%) and posterior vaginal wall in four patients (14%%), and had a mean volume of 590 \u00b1 140 cm(3). Laboratory data included leukocytosis (71%%), thrombocytosis (57%%) and elevated liver enzymes (18%%). Nine patients (33%%) required ultrasound-guided drainage of the hematoma, which resulted in marked clinical improvement. Surgical outcome was not affected by the presence of pelvic hematoma.Conclusions: A postoperative symptomatic pelvic hematoma is not rare and is closely related to transvaginal hysterectomy. Its clinical presentation includes fever, pelvic pain, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and occasionally liver dysfunction. Surgical outcome is generally unaffected.;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20674137/

Obstructive voiding symptoms were recorded from Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 questionnaires.Results: Of the 81 women aged 44-80 years who were included in the study, 40 (49.4%%) reported incomplete bladder emptying preoperatively. There was no significant difference between these women and asymptomatic women in terms of demographic and clinical parameters such as age, parity, and stage of prolapse. Furthermore, there was no significant difference with regard to postvoid residual bladder volume (52.8 \u00b1 65.8 vs 41.6 \u00b1 41.2 mL), maximal (23.8 \u00b1 11 vs 21.9 \u00b1 9.6 mL/second) and average (10.3 \u00b1 6.2 vs 9.3 \u00b1 4 mL/second) urinary flow velocities, prevalence of increased postvoid residual volume (10.0%% vs 4.8%%), or obstructive urinary flow (17.5%% vs 7.3%%).Conclusion: Almost half of all women with advanced POP experienced incomplete bladder emptying; however, this symptom did not correlate with objective urodynamic bladder outflow tract obstruction.";https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20708183/

Articles were identified through a PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and the national research Register literature search according to preset criteria followed by a cross-reference of published data.Main outcome measure(s): Clinical pregnancies and live births.Result(s): Most adjuvant therapies for IVF are empirical, and prescribed without a clear diagnosis of whether the failure to conceive is due to a maternal or fetal factor. Although some randomized controlled trials are available, the results are conflicting.Conclusion(s): No adjuvant therapy has been shown to be definitively advantageous. At present the diagnosis of IVF failure is not specific enough to indicate a certain adjuvant therapy. Hence, some unconfirmed therapies might be highly efficacious for subgroups with particular characteristics. The use of endometrial biopsy with a pipelle is promising, but like other therapies, requires additional testing. Chromosomal aberrations present a confounding factor for maternal adjuvant therapies that are difficult to exclude.;null

We therefore aimed to assess whether women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse have a higher prevalence of hernia.Methods: We reviewed charts of women undergoing surgery for advanced pelvic organ prolapse and compared them to age-matched controls with mild or no prolapse.Results: We identified 60 patients who underwent surgery for advanced pelvic organ prolapse and 60 controls. The total prevalence of hernias was significantly higher among patients with pelvic organ prolapse (31.6%% vs. 5%%, p = 0.0002), attributed to hiatal (16.6%% vs. 1.6%%, p = 0.004) and inguinal (15%% vs. 3.3%%, p = 0.04) hernias.Conclusions: Patients with advanced pelvic organ prolapse have a higher prevalence of hiatal and inguinal hernias.

The objective of this study was to assess the level of pain associated with this test.Methods: We reviewed charts of women who underwent multichannel urodynamic testing for lower urinary tract symptoms and recorded pain levels using a validated visual analog pain scale of 0-10 before, during, and 1.5 h after the test.Results: We identified 50 patients who underwent the test. Pain level increased mildly but significantly during the urodynamic test (1.24 +/- 0.9 vs 0.02 +/- 0.14 p < 0.001) and decreased thereafter (0.1 +/- 0.35, p < 0.001).Conclusions: Multichannel urodynamic testing is associated with a low but significant level of pain, which generally abates shortly after the procedure.

Regression analysis for the exact score reveals that apart from the cross-platform predictive power of the author\u2019s impact and review length, search goods and experience goods differ in what makes them useful. Structural review features are significant for experience goods but insignificant for search products. Discrete negative emotions correlate positively with the usefulness of reviews, more so for experience goods.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468696420300215?dgcid=author

From the collective dynamics of organizations and online communities to the spreading of information and fake news, to name a few, temporal dynamics are fundamental in the understanding of complex systems. In this work, we quantify the level of engagement in dynamic complex systems of interactions, modeled as networks. We focus on interaction networks for which the dynamics of the interactions are coupled with that of the topology, such as online messaging, forums, and emails. We define two indices to capture the temporal level of engagement: the Temporal Network (edge) Intensity index, and the Temporal Dominance Inequality index. Our surprising results are that these measures are stationary for most measured networks, regardless of vast fluctuations in the size of the networks in time. Moreover, more than 80%% of weekly changes in the indices values are bounded by less than 10%%. The indices are stable between the temporal evolution of a network but are different between networks, and a classifier can determine the network the temporal indices belong to with high success. We find an exception in the Enron management email exchange during the year before its disintegration, in which both indices show high volatility throughout the inspected period.;https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-019-0181-9

ossimokryn;9;;PLoS ONE;03-08-2016;"The rich get richer principle, manifested by the Preferential attachment (PA) mechanism, is widely considered one of the major factors in the growth of real-world networks. PA stipulates that popular nodes are bound to be more attractive than less popular nodes; for example, highly cited papers are more likely to garner further citations. However, it overlooks the transient nature of popularity, which is often governed by trends. Here, we show that in a wide range of real-world networks the recent popularity of a node, i.e., the extent by which it accumulated links recently, significantly influences its attractiveness and ability to accumulate further links. We proceed to model this observation with a natural extension to PA, named Trending Preferential Attachment (TPA), in which edges become less influential as they age. TPA quantitatively parametrizes a fundamental network property, namely the network\u2019s tendency to trends. Through TPA, we find that real-world networks tend to be moderately to highly trendy. Networks are characterized by different susceptibilities to trends, which determine their structure to a large extent. Trendy networks display complex structural traits, such as modular community structure and degree-assortativity, occurring regularly in real-world networks. In summary, this work addresses an inherent trait of complex networks, which greatly affects their growth and structure, and develops a unified model to address its interaction with preferential attachment.";http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%%2Fjournal.pone.0156505

ossimokryn;12;;Preprint arxiv.org;06-06-2013;Modeling complex networks has been the focus of much research for over a decade. Preferential attachment (PA) is considered a common explanation to the self organization of evolving networks, suggesting that new nodes prefer to attach to more popular nodes. The PA model results in broad degree distributions, found in many networks, but cannot explain other common properties such as: The growth of nodes arriving late and Clustering (community structure). Here we show that when the tendency of networks to adhere to trends is incorporated into the PA model, it can produce networks with such properties. Namely, in trending networks, newly arriving nodes may become central at random, forming new clusters. In particular, we show that when the network is young it is more susceptible to trends, but even older networks may have trendy new nodes that become central in their structure. Alternatively, networks can be seen as composed of two parts: static, governed by a power law degree distribution, and a dynamic part governed by trends, as we show on Wiki pages. Our results also show that the arrival of trending new nodes not only creates new clusters, but also has an effect on the relative importance and centrality of all other nodes in the network. This can explain a variety of real world networks in economics, social and online networks, and cultural networks. Products popularity, formed by the network of people's opinions, exhibit these properties. Some lines of products are increasingly susceptible to trends and hence to shifts in popularity, while others are less trendy and hence more stable. We believe that our findings have a big impact on our understanding of real networks.;http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0808

Cloud-based TRE needs to apply a judicious use of cloud resources so that the bandwidth cost reduction combined with the additional cost of TRE computation and storage would be optimized. PACK's main advantage is its capability of offloading the cloud-server TRE effort to end-clients, thus minimizing the processing costs induced by the TRE algorithm. Unlike previous solutions, PACK does not require the server to continuously maintain clients' status. This makes PACK very suitable for pervasive computation environments that combine client mobility and server migration to maintain cloud elasticity. PACK is based on a novel TRE technique, which allows the client to use newly received chunks to identify previously received chunk chains, which in turn can be used as reliable predictors to future transmitted chunks. We present a fully functional PACK implementation, transparent to all TCP-based applications and network devices. Finally, we analyze PACK benefits for cloud users, using traffic traces from various sources.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425531

The distributed algorithm is based on short range communication between neighboring sensors, and is designed to work with very basic low cost binary sensors, that can report only a sensing, not sensing value.Neighboring sensors that sense the object form a cloud around the object which is dynamically updated as the object moves. To save energy on reporting a subset of the cloud, the cloud core, is elected. A trade-off between the accuracy and the core size (namely transmission power) is presented, as well as an extensive simulation study. Our algorithm works well with false negative sensing and up to 10%% false positive sensing.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870513001248

To identify the most useful reviews, many web sites enable readers to vote on which reviews they find useful. In this work we use three hypotheses to predict which reviews will be voted useful. The first is that useful reviews induce feelings. The second is that useful reviews are both informative and expressive, thus contain less adjectives while being longer. The third hypoth- esis is that the reviewer\u2019s history can be used as a predictor.

In more severe cases, surgical intervention is common. Hypomobility of the many joints of the foot and ankle may be mistaken as an idiopathic cavus foot deformity.

Recovering the lost absorption cross section is of great importance for various applications of light-matter interactions, particularly in quantum optics, but no recovery mechanism has yet been identified and successfully demonstrated. Here, we formulate the limit set by the inhomogeneity on the absorption, and present a mechanism able to circumvent this limit and fully recover the homogeneous absorption of the ensemble. We experimentally study this mechanism using two different level schemes in atomic vapors and demonstrate up to fivefold enhancement of the absorption above the inhomogeneous limit.

We show that this effect is general, common to both absorption and transparency resonances, and favorably scales with wavelength mismatch. We experimentally confirm the enhancement of transitions for different low-lying orbitals in rubidium atoms and use calculations to extrapolate to high-lying Rydberg orbitals. These calculations predict a dramatic enhancement of up to 20-fold increase in absorption, even in the presence of large homogeneous broadening. More general configurations, where an auxiliary dressing field is used to counteract Doppler broadening, are also discussed and experimentally demonstrated.

This is especially challenging because of numerous degrees of complexity stemming from factors that include a multifactorial complex mechanism of action, cell source, inherent cell characteristics, culture method, administration mode and the in vivo conditions to which the cells are exposed. The expected biological function of a CTP encompasses complex interactions that range from a biochemical, metabolic or immunological activity to structural replacement of damaged tissue or organ. Therefore, the requirements for full characterization of the active substance with respect to biological function could be taxing. Moreover, the specific mechanism of action is often difficult to pinpoint to a specific molecular entity; rather, it is more dependent on the functionality of the cellular components acting in a in a multifactorial fashion. In the case of ischemic conditions, the cell therapy mechanism of action can vary from angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and arteriogenesis that may activate different pathways and clinical outcomes. The CTP cellular attributes with relation to the suggested mechanism of action can be used for the development of quantitative and reproducible analytical potency assays. CTPs selected and released on the basis of such potency assays should have the highest probability of providing meaningful clinical benefit for patients.

Stem/progenitor cell treatments with bone marrow-derived cells show safety and promising outcomes, albeit not without some preprocedural adverse events related to cell collection and mobilization. We describe a novel technology for generating a therapeutic population (BGC101) of enriched endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from non-mobilized blood, using dendritic cells to specifically direct stem/progenitor cell activity in vitro.METHODS AND RESULTS:Selected immature plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells from 24 healthy and two diabetic donors were activated with anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic molecules to induce specific activation signals. Co-culturing of activated dendritic cells with stem/progenitor cells for 12-66\u2009h generated 83.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) BGC101 cells with 97%% viability from 250\u2009mL of blood. BGC101, comprising 52.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5%% EPCs (expressing Ulex-lectin, AcLDL uptake, Tie2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 2, and CD31), 16.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9%% stem/progenitor cells (expressing CD34 and CD184) and residual B and T helper cells, demonstrated angiogenic and stemness potential and secretion of interleukin-8, interleukin-10, vascular endothelial growth factor and osteopontin. When administered to immunodeficient mice with limb ischemia (n\u2009=\u200940), BGC101 yielded a high safety profile and significantly increased blood perfusion, capillary density and leg function after 21\u2009days. Cell tracking and biodistribution showed that engraftment was restricted to the ischemic leg.CONCLUSIONS:These observations provide preliminary evidence that alternatively activated dendritic cells can promote the generation of EPC-enriched stem/progenitor cells within a 1-day culture. The resulting product BGC101 has the potential for treatment of various vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral ischemia.;null

Sometimes I find that if you are a people's person, reaching out to fellow co-workers or employees in a goal to achieve teamwork regardless of position at first, creates better revenue.as we spare more time fornew potential work, Time=Money.I believe that once goals are achieved and revenue increases, it will be easier to initiate bonus plan's and group trip's and or vacations, a great tool to achieve team building and binding. This is also a tool for long lasting relationship between company's to its employees and decreasing frequent employee changes.The idea is having your responsibilitys achieved, while continuing your outreach in a goal to achieve followers that will alltimatly believe in YOU...!!

sne-darki-morag-17b522160;1;;Cells;29-08-2019;Processing massive transcriptomic datasets in a meaningful manner requires novel, possibly interdisciplinary, approaches. One principle that can address this challenge is the Benford law (BL), which posits that the occurrence probability of a leading digit in a large numerical dataset decreases as its value increases. Here, we analyzed large single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets to test whether cell types and tissue origins can be differentiated based on the adherence of specific genes to the BL. Then, we used the Benford adherence scores of these genes as inputs to machine-learning algorithms and tested their separation accuracy. We found that genes selected based on their first-digit distributions can distinguish between cell types and tissue origins. Moreover, despite the simplicity of this novel feature-selection method, its separation accuracy is higher than that of the mean-expression level approach and is similar to that of the differential expression approach. Thus, the BL can be used to obtain biological insights from massive amounts of numerical genomics data\u2014a capability that could be utilized in various biomedical applications, e.g., to resolve samples of unknown primary origin, identify possible sample contaminations, and provide insights into the molecular basis of cancer subtypes.;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/9/1004

ortal-yom-tov-a5abb842;1;;European Polymer Journal;01-11-2015;Poly (ethylene glycol)-Thiol (PEG-Thiol) hydrogels are a prime example for biocompatible hydrogels that are used in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and regenerative medicine. Different cross-linking chemistries exist in order to create hydrogel networks of PEG-Thiol hydrogels, with Michael-type addition reactions and acrylate polymerization being the most popular ones. Here we tested hydrogels composed of PEGDA and 4-arm PEG-Thiol (PEG-4SH) with equimolar ratios between acrylates and thiols. The polymer solutions of PEG-4SH were mixed for different time intervals prior to their mixing with PEGDA solutions. Swelling experiments, rheology testing and Young's modulus measurements were performed in order to study structure and properties of the resultant hydrogels. The manipulation of architecture and properties was achieved by alterations in the preparation procedure. Consequently, this methodology, which gives further insights into the impact of the polymerization mechanism on PEG-Thiol based hydrogel properties, can be readily applied to develop hydrogel biomaterials that are tailor-made for specific biomedical applications.;null
ortal-yom-tov-a5abb842;2;;Materials Science and Engineering C;18-05-2015;The use of buoyant or floating hydrogel tablets is of particular interest in the sustained release of drugs to the stomach. They have an ability to slow the release rates of drugs by prolonging their absorption window in the upper part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study we synthesized bioactive hydrogels that have sustainable release rates for drugs in the stomach based on a hydrogel preparation technique that employs emulsifying surfactants. The emulsion gelation technique, which encapsulates oil droplets within the hydrogels during crosslinking, was used to decrease their specific gravity in aqueous environments, resulting in floating drug release depots. Properties such as swelling, buoyancy, density and drug release were manipulated by changing the polymer concentrations, surfactant percentages and the oil:polymer ratios. The relationship between these properties and the hydrogel\u2019s floating lag time was documented. The potential for this material to be used as a floating drug delivery system was demonstrated.;null
ortal-yom-tov-a5abb842;3;;Acta Biomaterialia;01-07-2014;The use of injectable porous hydrogels is of great interest in biomedical applications due to their excellent permeability and ease of integration into sites of surgical intervention. By implementing a method that enables the formation in situ of pores with controllable porosity and pore size, it is possible to synthesize bioactive hydrogels that are tailor-made for specific biomedical applications. An emulsion-templating technique was used to encapsulate oil droplets, which are subsequently leached out of the hydrogel to create the porous structure. Pore size and porosity were manipulated by changing oil-to-water ratios and the surfactant concentrations. Highly swellable porous hydrogels were obtained with control over mechanical strength and diffusive properties. The relationship between porosity, pore size, and the hydrogel\u2019s physical and mechanical characteristics was analyzed, and the potential of this material as a protein drug delivery system was demonstrated.;null
ortal-yom-tov-a5abb842;4;;Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A;25-02-2014;Even though inducing structural features on the nanometric scale has been shown to be a powerful tool in tissue engineering, almost all nanostructuring techniques available today cannot be applied to injectable hydrogel scaffolds. The current research explores such a novel technique and its effect on scaffold's properties, cell morphology, and cell-material interaction. Nanostructuring is achieved by covalently binding Pluronic\u00ae F127 molecules to biosynthetic hydrogels. Analysis of cell morphology revealed spindled cell morphologies at day 4 in culture. The bound Pluronic\u00ae F127 diminished the swelling ability and enhanced the Young modulus, thus indicating that the bound molecules crosslink the hydrogel. The relation between matrix characteristics and cell morphology was analyzed and the importance of nanostructuring was demonstrated.;null
ortal-yom-tov-a5abb842;5;;European Polymer Journal;05-01-2014;Nanostructured hydrogels tailor-made for specific applications are new grounds for the creation of novel soft materials. The current research presents a new method for hydrogel nanostructuring involving the incorporation of Pluronic\u00ae F127 micelles mixed with acrylated blockcopolymer molecules, which enable the attachment of these micelles to the hydrogel matrix through their endgroups. This design impacts the hydrogel nanostructure as well as its swelling and mechanical properties. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM) revealed that photochemical crosslinking of the hydrogel caused immobilization of the nanostructured micelles. Mechanical and weight gain experiments demonstrated a significant impact of these nanostructures on the hydrogel\u2019s elastic modulus as well as the transient and equilibrium weight gain ability of the material.;null
ortal-yom-tov-a5abb842;6;;Journal of separation science;25-01-2010;A novel approach for enhancing protein recognition in molecularly imprinted hydrogel (MIH) is presented. This approach was developed based on the hypothesis that the number of specific binding sites created in the previously described MIH is very small, thus attempts to enhance the capacity result in most cases in additional non-specific binding and loss of selectivity. Thus, blocking the non-specific binding sites could lead to higher capacities and better selectivity. To test this hypothesis, MIH interpenetrating networks designed to block non-specific binding sites were synthesized using two separate stages of polymerization. Re-binding of the template protein (lysozyme) and a competitor protein (cytochrome C) was measured, and the results were compared with the similar experiment performed using a control non-imprinted hydrogel and a \u201cconventional\u201d MIH. The imprinting efficacy of the MIH interpenetrating network was found to be much higher than that of the controls. Furthermore, competitive adsorption assays have demonstrated the superiority of the new formulation.;null

eliyahushear;1;;Chessed Ve'Emet (CreateSpace);05-04-2016;The Torah is the blueprint of Creation. God looked into the Torah and created the world. The Zohar teaches that God looked into the Torah once, twice, three times and four, before He created the world... It is a mitzvah for a Jew to study the weekly parshah each week - together with the entire community. On Shabbat, the parshah is read in shul. Many understand the text in the original Hebrew. Many struggle and read a full English translation. Now, the parshiyot have been concisely summarised for those who would like to get a simple grasp of each parshah in two minutes (or perhaps a little more)! These simple summaries can be read at the Shabbat table so that the entire family can hear the most important parts of the parshah during the meal. They can be used for further discussion. They are also a great way to revise important points to remember the main themes of the parshah at any time! Use them to prepare for school tests - as you get the gist of the parshah in just a couple of minutes! Use these summaries as a springboard to further your learning, working through the entire parshah at a later stage - with the necessary and important Torah commentaries such as Rashi. Each Book opens with some beautiful Torah quotations sharing hints about the parshiyot to come... or simply carry an important lesson to consider while reading, or discussing the weekly Torah portion.;https://www.amazon.com/Parshah-Just-Two-Minutes-Summaries/dp/1530446546/

aviv-shamsian;1;;ECCV 2020 (Springer);01-07-2020;Object Permanence allows people to reason about the location of non-visible objects, by understanding that they continue to exist even when not perceived directly. Object Permanence is criticalfor building a model of the world since objects in natural visual scenes dynamically occlude and contain each-other. Intensive studies in developmental psychology suggest that object permanence is a challenging task that is learned through extensive experience.Here we introduce the setup of learning Object Permanence from labeledvideos. We explain why this learning problem should be dissected into four components, where objects are (1) visible, (2) occluded, (3) contained by another object, and (4) carried by a containing object. The fourth subtask, where a target object is carried by a containing object, is particularly challenging because it requires a system to reason about a moving location of an invisible object. We then present a unified deep architecture that learns to predict object location under these four scenarios. We evaluate the architecture and system on a new dataset based on CATER and find that it outperforms previous localization methods and various baselines.;https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10469

Capabilities for electrically probing complex, physicochemical and biological three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments demand, however, 3D electronic scaffolds with well-controlled geometries and functional-component distributions. This work presents the development of flexible 3D electronic scaffolds with precisely defined dimensions and microelectrode configurations formed using a process that relies on geometric transformation of 2D precursors by compressive buckling. It demonstrates a capability to fabricate these constructs in diverse 3D architectures and/or electrode distributions aimed at achieving an enhanced level of control and regulation of tissue function relatively to that of other approaches. In addition, this work presents the integration of these 3D electronic scaffolds within engineered 3D cardiac tissues, for monitoring of tissue function, controlling tissue contraction through electrical stimulation, and initiating on-demand, local release of drugs, each through well-defined volumetric spaces.

Cardiomyocytes seeded onto the electronic scaffolds organized into a functional cardiac tissue and their function was recorded on-line.

This is caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality. While a myocardial infarction (MI), which is caused by the occlusion of a coronary artery supplying blood to the myocardium, is probably the best known and most common cause of heart failure, many other diseases may lead to such an outcome (1). An acute MI leads to loss of cardiac tissue due to necrosis, which leads to a deterioration of the structural integrity of the heart. Next, scar tissue is formed, followed by the thinning of the myocardium itself (2). To prevent the damage caused to the myocardium and relieve the stress on the thinning tissue, the concept of cardiomyoplasty was introduced.

In this context, mutually beneficial interactions can evolve that support efficient reproduction of both phages and bacteria. Temperate phages are integrated into the bacterial chromosome as large DNA insertions that can disrupt gene expression, and they may pose a fitness burden on the cell. However, they have also been shown to benefit their bacterial hosts by providing new functions in a bacterium\u2013phage symbiotic interaction termed lysogenic conversion. In this Opinion article, we discuss another type of bacterium\u2013phage interaction, active lysogeny, in which phages or phage-like elements are integrated into the bacterial chromosome within critical genes or operons and serve as switches that regulate bacterial genes via genome excision.;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3527

ron-feiner-a1060b87;19;;Biomaterials;01-11-2013;Recapitulation of the cellular microenvironment of the heart, which promotes cell contraction, remains a key challenge in cardiac tissue engineering. We report here on our work, where for the first time, a 3-dimensional (3D) spring-like fiber scaffold was fabricated, successfully mimicking the coiled perimysial fibers of the heart. We hypothesized that since in vivo straightening and re-coiling of these fibers allow stretching and contraction of the myocardium in the direction of the cardiomyocytes, such a scaffold can support the assembly of a functional cardiac tissue capable of generating a strong contraction force. In this study, the mechanical properties of both spring-like single fibers and 3D scaffolds composed of them were investigated. The measurements showed that they have increased elasticity and extensibility compared to corresponding straight fibers and straight fiber scaffolds.

Here we report a simple approach for fabricating 3-dimensional (3D) gold nanoparticle (NP)-based fibrous scaffolds, for engineering functional cardiac tissues generating a strong contraction force. A polycaprolactone\u2013gelatin mixture was electrospun to obtain fibrous scaffolds with an average fiber diameter of 250 nm. In a facile method, gold NPs were evaporated on the surface of the fibers, creating nanocomposites with a nominal gold thickness of 2, 4, and 14 nm. Compared to pristine scaffolds, cardiac cells seeded on the nano-gold scaffolds assembled into more elongated and aligned tissues. The gold NPs on the fibers were able to maintain the ratio of cardiomyocytes to fibroblasts in the culture, to encourage the growth of cardiomyocytes with \u2026;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/tb/c3tb20584c/unauth#!divAbstract

keren-cohen-17276633;1;;Endocr Relat Cancer;25-01-2018;Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy in which involvement of the thyroid hormone-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 pathway was shown, and pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway is a rational approach to disease management. A thyroid hormone derivative, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), which inhibits l-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, was studied in five MM cell lines and primary bone marrow (BM) MM cells. Tetrac inhibited MM cell proliferation (absolute cell number/viability) and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis (annexin-V/PI and cell cycle). Activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was further demonstrated. Moreover, DNA damage markers, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP-1) and histone \u03b3H2AX were induced by tetrac. The various tetrac-initiated effects were attenuated by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide, suggesting integrin involvement. Primary BM mononuclear cells were harvested from MM patients (n\u2009=\u200939) at various disease stages. Tetrac-induced apoptosis (12/17 samples) and sensitized the cytotoxic action of bortezomib (6/9 samples). Lastly, expression of plasma membrane integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was shown not only in the malignant plasma clone, but also in other cell populations within the BM samples (n\u2009=\u200925). Tetrac is anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic in MM and cells may offer a therapeutic approach for this disease.;null
keren-cohen-17276633;2;03-01-03-23;Leuk Lymphoma;01-04-2015;Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) induce proliferation in multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines via the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We further show in primary MM bone marrow (BM) samples (n = 9) induction of cell viability by 1 nM T3 (13%%, p < 0.002) and more potently by 100 nM T4 (21-45%%, p < 0.0002) and a quick (1 h) and long-lasting (24 h) pERK activation, which was inhibited in the presence of \u03b23 but not \u03b21 blocking antibodies. Involvement of the integrin was further shown by two disintegrins, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and echistatin peptides, which occluded the effects of T3/T4 on viability, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (proliferation marker) and apoptotic gene expression. Lastly, T3/T4 significantly opposed bortezomib (25 nM) cytotoxicy, as confirmed by several methods. In summary, our results imply that endogenous thyroid hormones in myeloma are factors that may support cell growth, with relevance to bortezomib action.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25058375
keren-cohen-17276633;3;09-03-01-03-23;Oncotarget;15-08-2014;"Thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, T3; L-thyroxine, T4) enhances cancer cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis via a discrete receptor located near the RGD recognition site on \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and its nanoparticulate formulation interfere with binding of T3/T4 to the integrin. This integrin is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM) and other cancers. MM cells interact with \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin to support growth and invasion. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes active in tissue remodeling and cancer. The association between integrins and MMPs secretion and action is well established. In the current study, we examined the effects of thyroid hormone on myeloma cell adhesion, migration and MMP activity. We show that T3 and T4 increased myeloma adhesion to fibronectin and induced \u03b1v\u03b23 clustering. In addition, the hormones induced MMP-9 expression and activation via \u03b1v\u03b23 and MAPK induction. Bortezomib, a standard myeloma treatment, caused a decrease in activity/quantity of MMPs and thyroid hormone opposed this effect. RGD peptide and tetrac impaired the production of MMP-9 in cell lines and in primary BM cells from myeloma patients. In conclusion, thyroid hormone-dependent regulation via \u03b1v\u03b23 of myeloma cell adhesion and MMP-9 production may play a role in myeloma migration and progression.";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071016
keren-cohen-17276633;4;03-01-03-23;Mol Cancer Res;01-10-2011;Experimental and clinical observations suggest that thyroid hormone [l-thyroxine (T(4)) and 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3))] can support cancer cell proliferation. T(3) and T(4) promote both tumor cell division and angiogenesis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via binding to a hormone receptor on the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, overexpressed on many cancer cells. We have studied the responsiveness of several MM cell lines to T(3) and T(4) and characterized hormonal effects on cell survival, proliferation, and MAPK activation. Overnight T(3) (1-100 nmol/L) and T(4) (100 nmol/L) incubation enhanced, up to 50%% (P < 0.002), MM cell viability (WST-1 assay) and increased cell proliferation by 30%% to 60%% (P < 0.01). Short exposure (10 minutes) to T(3) and T(4) increased MAPK activity by 2.5- to 3.5-fold (P < 0.03). Pharmacologic MAPK inhibition blocked the proliferative action of T(3) and T(4). Antibodies to the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 dimer and \u03b1v and \u03b23 monomers (but not \u03b21) inhibited MAPK activation and subsequent cell proliferation in response to thyroid hormone, indicating dependence upon this integrin. Moreover, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a non-agonist T(4) analogue previously shown to selectively block T(3)/T(4) binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor site, blocked induction of MAPK by the hormones in a dose-dependent manner. This demonstration of the role of thyroid hormones as growth factors for MM cells may offer novel therapeutic approaches.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821675
anna-vaisman-mentesh-3a8aa667;1;;Frontiers in Immunology;18-08-2020;Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a crucial asset for human health and modern medicine, however, the repeated administration of mAbs can be highly immunogenic. Drug immunogenicity manifests in the generation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), and some mAbs show immunogenicity in up to 70%% of patients. ADAs can alter a drug\u2019s pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, reducing drug efficacy. In more severe cases, ADAs can neutralize the drug\u2019s therapeutic effects or cause severe adverse events to the patient. While some contributing factors to ADA formation are known, the molecular mechanisms of how therapeutic mAbs elicit ADAs are not completely clear. Accurate ADA detection is necessary to provide clinicians with sufficient information for patient monitoring and clinical intervention. However, ADA assays present unique challenges because both the analyte and antigen are antibodies, so most assays are cumbersome, costly, time consuming, and lack standardization. This review will discuss aspects related to ADA formation following mAb drug administration. First, we will provide an overview of the prevalence of ADA formation and the available diagnostic tools for their detection. Next, we will review studies that support possible molecular mechanisms causing the formation of ADA. Finally, we will summarize recent approaches used to decrease the propensity of mAbs to induce ADAs.;https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01951
anna-vaisman-mentesh-3a8aa667;2;2032-02;Current Protocols in Molecular Biology;01-04-2020;"Antibodies are widely used in therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications, and antibody derivatives such as F(ab\u2032)2 fragments are used when only a particular antibody region is required. F(ab\u2032)2 can be produced through antibody engineering, but some applications require F(ab\u2032)2 produced from an original formulated antibody or directly from a polyclonal antibody pool. The cysteine protease immunoglobulin\u2010degrading enzyme (IdeS) from Streptococcus pyogenes digests immunoglobulin G (IgG) specifically and efficiently to produce F(ab\u2032)2. Here we detail the production and purification of recombinant IdeS; its utilization to digest monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to F(ab\u2032)2 fragments; and F(ab\u2032)2 purification through consecutive affinity chromatography steps. The resultant F(ab\u2032)2 exhibit high purity, retain antigen\u2010binding functionality, and are readily utilizable in various downstream applications.";https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpmb.119
anna-vaisman-mentesh-3a8aa667;3;03-01;Frontiers In Immunology;01-12-2019;Drugs formulated from monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are clinically effective in various diseases. Repeated administration of mAbs, however, elicits an immune response in the form of anti-drug-antibodies (ADA), thereby reducing the drug's efficacy. Notwithstanding their importance, the molecular landscape of ADA and the mechanisms involved in their formation are not fully understood. Using a newly developed quantitative bio-immunoassay, we found that ADA concentrations specific to TNF\u03b1 antagonists can exceed extreme concentrations of 1 mg/ml with a wide range of neutralization capacity. Our data further suggest a preferential use of the \u03bb light chain in a subset of neutralizing ADA. Moreover, we show that administration of TNF\u03b1 antagonists result in a vaccine-like response whereby ADA formation is governed by the extrafollicular T cell-independent immune response. Our bio-immunoassay coupled with insights on the nature of the immune response can be leveraged to improve mAb immunogenicity assessment and facilitate improvement in therapeutic intervention strategies.;https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02921

yuvalal;1;;PLOS One;08-03-2018;"Existing approaches to describe social interactions consider emotional states or use ad-hoc descriptors for microanalysis of interactions. Such descriptors are different in each context thereby limiting comparisons, and can also mix facets of meaning such as emotional states, short term tactics and long-term goals. To develop a systematic set of concepts for second-by-second social interactions, we suggest a complementary approach based on practices employed in theater. Theater uses the concept of dramatic action, the effort that one makes to change the psychological state of another. Unlike states (e.g. emotions), dramatic actions aim to change states; unlike long-term goals or motivations, dramatic actions can last seconds. We defined a set of 22 basic dramatic action verbs using a lexical approach, such as \u2018to threaten\u2019\u2013the effort to incite fear, and \u2018to encourage\u2019\u2013the effort to inspire hope or confidence. We developed a set of visual cartoon stimuli for these basic dramatic actions, and find that people can reliably and reproducibly assign dramatic action verbs to these stimuli. We show that each dramatic action can be carried out with different emotions, indicating that the two constructs are distinct. We characterized a principal valence axis of dramatic actions. Finally, we re-analyzed three widely-used interaction coding systems in terms of dramatic actions, to suggest that dramatic actions might serve as a common vocabulary across research contexts. This study thus operationalizes and tests dramatic action as a potentially useful concept for research on social interaction, and in particular on influence tactics.";http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193404
