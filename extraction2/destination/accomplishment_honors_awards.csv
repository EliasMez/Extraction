In many cases, these achievements would not have been possible without the support of family, teachers and coaches \u2013 hence these awards also celebrate indirectly all the people who have contributed to the success of our young.

And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.Home Credit GroupHome Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\nShow moreShow less

Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival.One year ago, the office of the U.S. Vice President spearheaded a bold new initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, to make a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years.In 2017, the Data Science Bowl will be a critical milestone in support of the Cancer Moonshot by convening the data science and medical communities to develop lung cancer detection algorithms.Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.This year, the Data Science Bowl will award $1 million in prizes to those who observe the right patterns, ask the right questions, and in turn, create unprecedented impact around cancer screening care and prevention. The funds for the prize purse will be provided by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.\nShow moreShow less

obadah-al-sawadi-96781313;1;2012-01;ADNOC;01-04-2013;"I had the privilege to be amongst the 1st Place Winning Team for the project submitted on \""Innovative Rigless Solution For Restoring The Integrity Of Downhole Safety Valve System\"". Downhole safety valves (DHSVs) play a critical role in preventing environmentally harmful oil spills from offshore wells, by automatically blocking the flow of oil and gas to the well surface in the event of flow irregularity. However, over time these crucial devices can become worn and lose responsiveness to surface remotes for automatic shutdown, requiring costly and time-intensive repairs and drastically increasing the likelihood of spills.Following a search for alternative repair techniques, ZADCO has decided to switch to using B-Type seals, which are not normally used with DHSVs. B-type seals may be installed and repaired using a rigless procedure, which is vastly preferable to the traditional well workover process. Each workover produces approximately 10,000 feet of pipe waste, as well as hazardous sludge and significant GHG emissions, and uses enormous amounts of energy; the new rigless approach results in almost zero waste, no hazardous sludge, and insignificant energy consumption. The new system also boasts great time efficiency, requiring only 3 hours of shutdown compared to 21 days for a workover. Since implementing this approach, ZADCO has successfully resumed operation in damaged wells while maintaining well integrity. Each well has been operational for 6 months without interruption or valve failure."

Informed by a colleague that a fight had broken out in the schoolyard, Mr. Walsh rushed to intervene. As he reached the scene, two of the attackers ran off while another continued beating the victim on the head with a metal bar. Without hesitation, Mr. Walsh tackled the armed assailant and struggled with him until he dropped the weapon. With complete disregard for his own safety, he then attempted to fight off the remaining aggressors who were continuing their assault on the downed victim. The gang finally fled when another teacher arrived on the scene and called the police."

This is a week long marketing competition in which teams of two (my self and my partner) must market for local businesses and earn profit for ideas and implementation of such ideas. Each team begins the competition with ten dollars ($10) and must pitch ideas to local businesses in hopes of improving their business and meeting their desires and needs. In the end of the competition myself and my partner had been able, through idea pitches and implementation of ideas, trade from $10 to a total of $3,140. The grand total of $3,140 earned us a position in the top three of all participating competitors. Once in the top three, presentations were made regarding what steps had been taken to earn profit and how ideas were implemented successfully, after presentations we finished the competition in third place (out of 23 teams)."

The video has also been enhanced for iPad viewing. It was rated 4+ stars on the App Store.
kevinplamondon;2;;IAC (Internet Advertising Competition);01-03-2011;Brother Customer Support SolutionsThe Business Objective: To build an online support module that would answer the 9 most frequently asked questions relating to the installation and network synchronization of Brother printers, fax machines and multi-function centers. The Solution: BlueRush created a solution for Brother that took into account how answers to FAQs might vary depending on the machine model, the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer operating system, and stage of installation. BlueRush also designed these modules in a way that allows them to be easily modified for other languages so they could be shared with their counterparts at Brother International. This was facilitated by using a silent host on screen so that only audio narrations and on-screen text would need to be changed. The resulting interactive production prompts visitors with questions, and then guides them automatically to the appropriate video response that they can follow step by step. The Result: Since the initial launch of these interactive FAQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Brother Canada has experienced over 20%% fewer requests for help at theirs call centers relative to specific machines and questions. Brother was so delighted with these results that they now include these interactive videos in a DVD format with the sale of machines.
kevinplamondon;3;;IAC (Internet Advertising Competition);01-03-2011;SunWise Essential Series -- Videos and MicrositeThe Business Objective CI Investments was looking to create a series of videos, and a microsite, to support the launch of product enhancements to the Sunwise Elite group of products. The target audience for the corporate videos are advisors, investors and potential and existing clientele. CI Investments met with BlueRush Digital Media in May, 2010 and is looking for our expertise in Financial Services and in video production to shoot, edit and produce these corporate videos. The key objectives of this project are: \u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Position CI Investments as a thought leader and partner of choice for advisors and investors \u201a Support CI Investments\u2122 corporate reputation and image The Solution BlueRush recommended a series of videos that introduce the product enhancements to the viewer and explain -- with case studies -- the benefits of the SunWise Elite group of products. We also suggested creating a new microsite that would house both the videos and other online and printed content for the SunWise Elite group of products. The result was a dynamic and engaging rich-media site that takes full advantage of the Adobe Flash\u2122 multimedia capabilities. .
kevinplamondon;4;;IAC (Internet Advertising Competition);01-03-2010;Juravinski Cancer CentreThe Juravinski Cancer Centre (JCC) Virtual Tour was recently launched to provide current and upcoming visitors to the Centre with an engaging, educating and welcoming tour. The JCC realized that first time visits to the Centre often are intimidating, without some knowledge of what to expect. The Centre\u2122 services and support are designed to provide a comfort to patients through difficult times. This same passion is shown through the Virtual Tour, an online experience through the different levels and areas of the Centre. The Tour was designed and produced using a hosted Rich Media microsite, using real footage and still photography from the JCC to provide a similar experience to a first time visit. This campaign was launched in late December 2009, so usage statistics are not currently available.
kevinplamondon;5;;IAC (Internet Advertising Competition);01-03-2009;My Bell Consolidated Billing VideoBell recently launched a new online, consolidated billing system for customers that have 1 or many bell services. Bell contracted BlueRush to create an online campaign that would leverage and promote Bell\u2122 new branding, provide a description and benefits of the service, as well as show users how simple the registration process is. With these goals in mind, BlueRush\u2122 creative team developed a simple, slick online interface that utilized Bell\u2122 new brand. BlueRush used Rich 3D Modelling Media technology to create a personal interactive experience using a host, and combined it with rich animation to clearly explain the benefits and registration process. The design also used chaptering, enabling users to choose content they were most interested in. This campaign was launched in December 2008, so usage statistics are not currently available.

The three-round tournaments include both Junior and Senior divisions. Membership is by invitation and open to Ontario independent schools.
jack-richardson-2b11b5173;2;;Ridley College;01-02-2017;Since 1992, Ridley College has held tradition of holding a formal debate close to Valentine\u2019s Day. While Ridley debating has a long history at the school, prior to 1992 the only debate that actually took place on the campus was the Fulford Cup. Member schools take turns hosting the Fulford Cup, meaning that Ridley would host only once every 6 years. In order to raise the profile of debating, and to feature and attract students to this important para-curricular activity, the co-coaches at the time decided to host an annual debate in second term in and around Valentine\u2019s Day. It started with a student campaign in 1992 with \u201cbring a date to the debate\u201d and the tradition grew from there.

gregtelford;1;;-;01-10-2016;During my time as a working professional in the Advertising industry I have developed a strong interest and passion for the strategy side of the business. In an attempt to satisfy my interests and grow my professional skill set I applied to the Beautiful Minds Canada program and was invited to participate.Following a day of presentations from educators, mentors, and industry professionals, the group of aspiring strategists was split into teams and was given the task of writing a creative strategy presentation for the client, Urbery. Urbery is a Toronto-based startup that competes in the online grocery delivery business.My team's strategy presentation was selected to compete against three other finalists in front of a live audience later in the week. In the end, we were not selected as the winners, but I still feel strongly that the program was an invaluable experience and I took away a lot of new skills and advice from it.
